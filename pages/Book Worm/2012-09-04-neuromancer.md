# Neuromancer

Just finished the [neuromancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) and have to say, I didn't like it that much. Yeah, i know it's dickish of me to say thing like that about an iconic work, but let me finish.

I do love cyberpunk as a next guy, and i do recognise neuromancer as an archetypical work in the field. And i did enjoy all the little funny references to the matrix, zion and the little Johnny story. That's all good fun, but i didn't like the book as a novel.

Although there are some pretty cool characters work in there, but most of them luck sense of motivation. Yeah, Case wanted back into the cyberspace, but did he really? He just pressed a bunch of buttons, jacked out and that's it, all he did in reality he was moaning about Linda and inability to get drunk. The rest of the bunch are just emotionless characters that did their thing.

And the storyline itself was rather boring, it quickly becomes obvious that it's an epic journey type of scenario, so the main character, just like a bunch of hobbits, will get to the volcano, drop the ring, get back, marry their high-school sweethearts and drink booze happily ever after.

And above all, it doesn't read well. It's really hard to get through all the descriptions of the environments.

## The Followups

What's interesting about the book is followup thoughts that it gives you. Like for example, there was this AI, it had a Swiss citizenship, but the hardware where it was running, belonged to a private corporation, which is kind of obvious but interesting idea.

So, in a while, when all our concisenesses will be uploaded to a large computer and we ride into the sunset for all the eternity, who will own the hardware? And how much will it cost to live there? And how much it will cost to get cured of viruses in there? and so on.

Which immediately brings you to the question, to whom your hardware belongs now?
