# Cloud Atlas

So, here's a dirty secret. I love books. You know that moment when you listen to really good piece of music and it vibrates with you so well that you get goose skin? Well, I get goose skin of good literature.

Anyways. Finished "Cloud Atlas". It's soo gloomy and depressive, I almost feel sick. But it's easily the best book I read in a while.

To be fair, it's six novels in one book, and every one of them is written in different language, style and level of awesomeness, but still, very very cool.

It's interesting how modern literature on theoretical stand of point does same thing as music and visual arts. It abstracts, gets away from plot and characters and scenes. "Cloud Atlas" is all like that, all the plot and story and things that are happening are secondary, it's all in the words texture and small details and the overall concept. It's like Mondrian or Malevich if you like.

It's abstract, but it's not poetry. It's not melodic. Or how author puts it himself. It's not Mozart, it's Stravinsky.

Which consequently brings us to the question: why would you want to make a movie out it?
