# Slaughterhouse Five

I had a friend once who used to say that _"reading fiction does things to your soul"_.
I like people who didn't loose the sense of their souls. That makes them human.

Sometimes I say to people that _I like humans_. And it's often awkward. Like if I
would say that I like spiders or snakes. You know, like it is some weird fetish
to me. A way to not conform to the norm.

But, I do like humans. I find us beautiful. In all the things we do: social protocols,
arts, science. Even in the shit we are taking each other through for whatever reason.
Human behavior is so complex, but animal at the same time.

And it means a lot to me when I see a person, who in all the mess of human conditions,
finds some sense of dignity. This tells me that they didn't give up on themselves.
This tells me that they still have a soul.

Vonnegut does things to your soul. Not pretty, nor easy ones. But, somehow, it leaves
you with the sense that you are understood. That you are not alone.
