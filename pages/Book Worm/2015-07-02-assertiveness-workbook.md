# Assertiveness Workbook

Do you often have a feeling that everyone around you is an idiot
and it is really hard to get anything done because of that? Or
maybe you have a feeling that you work too much and people around
you are just a-holes who abuse your kindness? Well, guess what?
It's your own fault.

It is unbelievable how much crap we humans have in our heads.
Crap that makes us suffer and crap that makes everyone around us
suffer as well. We just label it something like _"human condition"_
or _"that's who i am"_ and keep doing the same thing over and over.
So frustrating.

Some of us had a fair chance in life, some of us had great role
models when we were growing. Some of us even were so lucky that
we were explained how it all works and how unhealthy behavioral
patterns can limit our options in life. But, some of us weren't
so lucky. Some of us require some help to get better at life.

This is not really a book in a normal sense of a book. This is
not kind of thing that one could just read through and miraculously
change their life (if there are any books like that at all).
"Assertiveness workbook" is just what it says; it is a workbook
that have lessons and exercises that can help a person to overcome
their unhealthy communication habits.

Although it sounds a bit dull, it's actually a great thing to read.
It explains in great details different communication styles, like
passive, aggressive, passive-agressive and dynamics of their interactions.
A lot of those things intuitively make sense, but the great thing
about this book is that it gives you a model and a language. That
helps you understand and reason about people's behavior. It will
help you to realize the roots of the problems you might have with
other human beings.

This book obviously won't cure you. It won't change who you are.
But what it will do, it will give you a fighting chance. And
sometimes that's all you really need.
