# Startupland

Firstly, a bit of a word of disclaimer. I generally don't
like auto-biographies that much. I find them rather melodramatic
and full of half-truths. Given that, my views on this sort
of books tend to be skewed by this perceptional filter. So,
please take whatever I write in here with an extra grain of salt.

First and foremost of all, there is nothing really new in this book.
Those guys, they did most of the things right for a startup:
the started low, loved their clients from the very beginning,
focused on growth in the right moment, and finally, went for
an IPO. So, if you are looking for some revelations, you
probably might wanna look somewhere else.

But, other than that, it is a pretty good read. I for one,
certainly miss the awesome startup vibe of San Francisco.
There is truly nothing like it in the rest of the world.
It is one of those Lorenz attractors things that make everything
else revolve around them. And in this regard I enjoyed the
story a fair bit.

The real question that bugs me after the book though is:
"do you really need to do that?". What is the "new generation
of enterprise software"? Do you absolutely need to grow beyond
the limits, dominate the market and try to push everyone out?

I was left with an impression that Zendesk didn't start with
the goal for the world domination. But, it was good and ended
up being sucked into the Californian vortex. So, the question
is whether it is an inherited property of the market field, or
is it the inner desire of founders that lead them onto the
path of "enterprise software".

Is it even theoretically possible to build a best in the
world software product, but keep it handmade and organic?
If it will be a truly good product, you will owe it to the
users to eventually scale it, right?

I feel like I need to sidestep and start looking at the things
from a different perspective.

And a footnote. Uprooting your family and move them half way
across the globe to let you to pursue your dreams. Quite
a thing to do.
