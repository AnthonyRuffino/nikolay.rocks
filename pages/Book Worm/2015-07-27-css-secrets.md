# CSS Secrets by Lea Verou

I think in all of my 15 years career, I never read a book about
#css before. Neither I thought I might need one some day. But,
@leaverou was pushing it really hard on her twitter feed, so I
eventually gave up and got a copy of the book for myself. So,
I guess it worked! :)

I'm generally a server side guy, but I think I can fend for myself
pretty well when it comes to the front-end stuff. So, as many before
me, I thought: _"what else do I need to know about the thing?"_. I
mean, it's CSS, just point and shoot. Turned out quite a lot.

CSS Secrets is not a book of revelations. It's not going to make
your brain explode. Neither it is something that will get you from
zero to awesome in one go. In fact, you will need to have a pretty
formidable skill level in CSS to fully appreciate the thing.

But, what it will give you — and I'd argue that it is even more important —
is a whole bunch of ideas, use cases and inspiration to push your CSS
chops further than ever before.

In my case it showed me many really useful tricks around creative
usage of multiple backgrounds in an element. The pie-charts trick
and the random backgrounds generator, that was brilliant! I would
never thought of it myself. There are also some cool hacks around
CSS animations and typography as well.

So, if you are a seasoned dev and you think you know CSS pretty
well, you might consider reading CSS Secrets. It will most likely
broaden your horizonts and give you some awesome ideas for your
work.
