# A Guide to the good life by Irvine William

Well, yeah. This book has such a cheesy name that for a long time
I was considering not to write anything about it. More of that, it
is written in just as cheesy language as well. But, it is a good
thing to read nevertheless.

## The Stoics

I don't remember exactly what triggered my interest in stoicism. But,
at some point I realized that I don't really know what people are talking
about. And I tried to self-educate a bit, and then this book popped up
as a nice intro into the topic.

In general, I think stoics tried to do the right thing. But it is,
largely, influenced by a rich dude mentality. Yeah, I know we're supposed
to call them _job providers_, but let me make some examples of wisdoms
that are routinely pop up here and there.

> Don't go to non-philosopher banquets.

I mean, get real. In the age when ~95% of population lived below the
poverty level, it was probably nice to have options of banquets.

> Don't try to make anyone like you.

When you're loaded, it's not like you actually need to give a damn
about anyone right? Try to grow with this mentality in a god forsaken
village in Siberia, where it is `-40C` outside in winter. We'll see
how far it will get you. Exile on a remote island in middleterranians?
Man, wish I could afford that!

> Don't make love to your wife unless you want to make babies.

I don't even...

Their whole lifestyle that revolved around being self-proclimed sudo
nonconformists is such a load of crap really. I mean, it's nice to
have an awesome view of your own life, and surely who doesn't want to
die a hero presumably serving his own people? After all, it is not like
your wife and kids will starve to death after you're gone, right?

## The Good Stuff

Although I've been perplexed by some insides into stoics views on life,
there are some good parts to it too. For example internalization of one
goals is a great idea I think.

I was always fascinated by how little working hard actually makes
people happy. Firstly you get all worked up and hard pressed by anxiety,
which spoils the journey. And then, when you get there — if you get there —
you all too exhausted to enjoy the fruits of your labor.

More of that, when you work hard to get something, it will get you in
a corner, and you will be afraid to loose what you have been working for.

Stoics had phrased it very well for me personally. Working hard to get
what you want won't get you happy. Doing what you love, on the other hand,
might.

One needs to enjoy the journey, enjoy the process, otherwise it is all
pointless.

## The Cool Things

In my personal view, there is not that much new in stoicism. It is 2000
years old after all. It all was rethought millions of times. Christianity,
in my mind, was largely built on the same principles.

The really cool thing I took from the book is actually how it all started.
We often take philosophy and religions in a rather dogmatic way. It always
presented as either a god given or thought up by some very smart people.

But, apparently, it was all shaped by free enterprise. According to this
book the early days of greek philosophical schools were kind of like a
startupland of the modern era.

All different schools were competing for pupils who were paying money to
be taught and educated. So, all those early philosophy schools were just
making things up to attract the students. And whoever was saying things
that masses liked better, turned a larger profit and survived.

It all makes total sense now why religions are so successful among humans.
It wasn't that some messiah saved us all by teaching us the right ways.
The messiahs were created by people themselves through the engine of a
free enterprise.

And we keep doing this over and over again. Look at the modern politics.
We keep electing those who please us the most and then blame them because
they said what we liked. Humans truly are fascinating!

Another cool thing is the origins of physics. As an ex wanna be physicist,
it totally blew my mind. Apparently, in the good old days of ancient greeks,
_physics_ was one of the philosophic disciplines. But unlike the modern
physics, it was more like a theology rather than science. People didn't really
have math, so they would reason about things like _"apple falls from the tree,
because God..."_.

Centuries passed and we replaced the god with an equation. _"mass converts to
energy, because e=mc^2"_. But, if you think of it, mechanically it is all the
same thing. We have just fooled ourselves into thinking that we understand
formulas better than the ancient pantheon of Gods. But, in the end, they both
are just made up by humans and use the same reasoning mechanics underneath
of them.

So, I feel like such a chump for buying into the whole religion vs. science
conflict when I was a student.

Anyways, it's a good read. If you don't mind grinding through some rather
pretentious writing, I'm sure you'll get a lot from it.
