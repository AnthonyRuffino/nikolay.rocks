# A Deepness In The Sky

I'm a bit of a sci-fi fun. I don't have plastic figurines at home, but I think
I watched all the major sci-fi movies dozens of times and went though most of the
important TV series as well.

Interestingly enough, one of my favorite pieces of the western sci-fi is the
Star Trek Enterprise series. Yeah, I know, most of the hardcore star trek funs
would boo me right here and never talk to me again. But, I find it rather hilarious
to watch americans on a starship eating cheeseburgers for dinner and showing
cowboy movies to the aliens.

I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't hate your freedoms. I just find it ridiculous
and sarcastic. It's kind of the same thing as the [Iron Sky](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314/),
but seen from the other end.

When I was growing as a kid in Soviet Union, the only types of sci-fi books I
would find in the local libraries were the ones that either depicted capitalism
as a total cluster-fuck or those where communists where owning the sky and
coca-cola would cost 5 rubles a can.

It didn't create any dissonance actually. Communist kids were coming back from
the future and fight crime. Grown up communists were going to other planets
and would have mad adventures with the aliens. One, very profound piece of
soviet sci-fi art [Andromeda Nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_(novel))
even featured a working communist parliament thing.

I actually think that that's how great sci-fi pieces of art even happen. It should
be an everyday, familiar thing, but shown from another angle. Like
[Firefly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)) for example. The
thing is though, it's a trap.

See, you can take a bunch of cowboy stories and replace a band wagon with a
firefly class star ship. Or, take a bunch of minstrel stories and replace
swords and shields with lightsabers, and it will work just fine. But then you
take a completely isolated non-humanoid alien race and tell the story of the
european world wars in their context, and it suddenly sounds kinda stretched;
even pretentious.

You take a story of the cold war and put it in the context of star faring
nations as a demonstration that capitalism will always prevail, and you kind of
look like you are writing a story of communist kids coming back from the future
to fight capitalists scum. It is degrading somehow.

The book is great. Very imaginative and intriguing. But the allegories it uses
to present the conflict are flat down boring. I'm not trying to offend anyone,
it is a highly regarded among sci-fi enthusiasts book. But, outside of the
north american context, it is the same story with yankees eating cheeseburgers
on starships and teaching aliens democracy.
