# Get Out Of Your Own Way: by Mark Goulston

Life can be hard. Like you know, you find yourself badly hurt
deep inside the woods. It's a beginning of a winter and your
blood looks vividly red on the atlas whiteness of fresh snow.
Your left arm goes limp.

It's a 10 kilometers hike to home. But, you have two good legs,
so you should make it. You just need to make sure that wolves
won't sniff your blood, or you're in for a whole world of troubles.

Life can be hard like that. But then it's dead simple. You need
to get your shit together, patch yourself up and walk straight
to safety.

But then, you can sit in an office. Year in, year out. And slowly
you start to have this unending thought cycle in your head: who
am I? how are they? why everything is so hard? and, what do I
really want here?

I'd rather walk 10 kilometers knee deep in the snow; an arm
broken and the face smashed. At least you don't have to ask
yourself _who am i? and, what am i doing wrong?_

This book is, hands down, one of the most depressing but true
books on self-defeating behavior patterns i've read in ages.
It's funny how learning works. At first you think you know things,
then you learn, and then you actually know things.

Dealing with humans can be hard. Being a human can be even harder.
Don't listen when people say "_you can't run from yourself_", i've
been running from myself for decades. The hard thing is facing
yourself. Facing your needs and feelings can be hurtful.

Understanding how you manage to screw yourself over and over again
is an unpleasant process. But, this guy is a professional
therapist and he speaks from decades of his work experience.
And the worst thing is that what he says makes total sense.

This book is like a glimpse of life outside of that Berlin wall
that you built around your soul. Because part of you still
didn't return from those snow filled woods; still running circles
being afraid that wolves will feel your blood.

But now you know. Now you actually know things and can work
on getting back home.
