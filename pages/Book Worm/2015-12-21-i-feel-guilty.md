# When I Say No, I Feel Guilty, by Manuel Smith

I'm continuing to go through my long overdue stack of books about brains and
stuff. This one I picked up when I was researching the topic of different
behavior styles and it was referred as one of the best books about assertive
approach in communication. This thing actually blew my mind a bit.

You know that feeling when you kinda know how things work; you have a _sense_ of
how it supposed to operate, but you can't quite articulate it or reason about it in
any sensible way. And then someone gives names to the "things" and it all of
the sudden clicks together and you can actually build a construct in your head?
Well, this book is kind of like that.

It is written by a practicing psychologist (and it's a bit hard to read). But, on
the other hand, it explains the human coping mechanisms in great details without
going into the weird territory of sub-consciousness or something like that.

In a few really simple examples it gives you the basic understanding and terminology
to reason about fight-flight responses and the way humans engage in manipulative
behavior. It makes you understand what you do wrong on both sides of a guilt,
fear or inadequacy inducing communication and how to deal with those problems.

It is kind of bizarre how simple it is when you understand the basics of the
construct. I should totally reread it again some day.
