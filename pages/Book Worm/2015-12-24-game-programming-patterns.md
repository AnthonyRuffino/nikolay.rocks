# Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom

I keep forgetting to write about this book. Not because it was so unmemorable,
but because life was a bit busy in the last couple of months. But, the book is
awesome and totally worth to be mentioned.

I remember reading software design books like GOF patterns or Fauler's enterprise
software patterns. Although they had explained a lot of practical things to me,
like for example why ruby on rails is designed this way, but they were some of
the most boring and dry books ever produced by humans!

I understand that some programmers prefer it this way. But to me it was a total
torture. To this day I have a huge grudge against patterns based approach to
software. Although now it is more of a personal experience thing, but I still
feel a bit of an annoyance in me towards programmers who think in software patterns.

So, at some point I got into games programming and someone suggested to read
the "Game Programming Patterns" book. I bought it and then was avoiding it like
for a year or so. Because I didn't want to go through the same thing over again.

Turned out that was quite stupid of me. The book is amazing! Well, considering
the topic. I love reading books written by game devs. They have imagination and
they bring it to their work everywhere; even to such seemingly dull topics as
software design patterns.

It is kind of a must read if you are serious about software development. Although
it focuses heavily on game programming and you might not benefit from it directly,
they way it explains the patterns is totally awesome. It is the best book on
patterns you will read. Period. Plus, it has plenty of peripheral knowledge in it
and generally amusing to read.

It might be a wrong book for you if you prefer it the long and boring way though.
