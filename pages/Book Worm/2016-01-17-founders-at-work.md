# Founders At Work, by Jessica Livingston

This one is a bit old book that was buried in my stack for a while now. Finally
I got to read it and turned out it is a pretty decent book. Well, at least I
can see why it is so popular.

The book is basically a collection of interviews with various founders of
successful companies. Which, I guess, is the prime cause to its popularity. And
it was fascinating to read about all those people inventing computers before I
was even born; or making gazillions on hotmail before I even knew there was such
thing as Internet. That kind of puts things in perspective.

And although it is quite inspirational and I had thoroughly enjoyed it, I kind
of felt I was wasting my time a lot. You see this is a collection of very cool
cool stories, but it is a clear case of survivorship bias. It talks about people
who made it, where statistically you should be more interested those who didn't.

In a way this book is a set of minstrel stories for startupers. Cute, but
impractical.

And an afterthought: interestingly enough it appears that most of those people
are so full of it. I kind of giggled when Wozniak said that he wrote the first
version of breakout in BASIC in 30 minutes. Seriously mate...

So, I'm wondering if this is a prerequisite for a success, like being able to
thoroughly delude oneself into believing something. Or is it a result of
re-telling the same story over and over after you officially made it? Maybe both?
