# A Fire Upon The Deep, by Vinge Vernor

This is the second book by Vernor that I've read. And I can see a pattern now.
The guy is really smart, and imaginative, and he's really good at explaining
rather complicated things; but, boy the books are torturous!

Both books were excruciatingly annoying at the beginning. In fact, I dropped both
of them at roughly ~10% and came back months later. Then, there are really great
middle parts. And, then there are agonizingly slow and stretched finales.

I really should stop starting sentences with ands and buts... I can do this!

Either way. Considering that I don't have as much time to read fiction as I
would love to; and my soul rotes away because of that. I don't regret reading
those two. They are painful to digest, but they are really good sci-fi. Well,
sometimes you need to work hard to get to the good stuff.

Now I need to get through "The Children of The Sky" and "The Blabber" and be done
with it.

PS: I was kind of disappointed with the finale of the book. But, it is not the
book, it is my personal preference, I guess. I quite dislike super-duper humans.
I think that is rather cheating. It was a bit sad to see it came to that after
a great run through the most of the book.

PPS: I should stop writing 'rather' and other pointless adjectives. I can do this!
