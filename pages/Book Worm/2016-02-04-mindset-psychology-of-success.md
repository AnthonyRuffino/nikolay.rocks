# Mindset: The New Psychology of Success

Another book that I picked from that famous "best books of 2015" list by Bill Gates.
I don't want to sound like a spitz barking at an elephant, but boy... For such
a major guy, he reads a ton of crap.

It is not that bad to be honest. If you are not familiar with the idea of static
vs. dynamic mindsets, you might find some of the stuff quite fascinating. But,
you don't need a whole freaking book to explain it! You could achieve the same
in a 10 paragraphs blog post. It is not a rocket science.

And worse of that, the book is full of all sorts of examples of famous people,
which are used to demonstrate the power of the idea. And from case to case it is
so stretched at will in every direction, just to fit the bill...

I don't know about you, but when I hear someone saying things like: "all people
fall into two categories: bla bla bla and bla bla bla". I honestly feel
like I'm being fucked right into my brain. The idea is ridiculous, and when you
have a whole book of this stuff, it quickly starts to feel like a waste of time.

Oh, well. There are plenty of other, really awesome books out there. Some of them
even have rainbows on their covers!
