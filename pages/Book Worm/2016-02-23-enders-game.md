# Book: The Ender's Game

I promised myself that every fifth book I read should be fiction. Just to keep
my soul from getting too rusty. Which, if you think of it, is a ridiculous idea
in its mechanical approach to soul maintenance. Well, I'm just trying to learn
how to cope with myself. I guess.

I find the process of aging interesting. It changes your brains, it changes who
you are, and it certainly changes how you perceive things. For example, I recently
noticed that faces on video game boxes, with years, changed for me from being a
reflection of ultimate grown-up badasses to look somewhat like faces of immature
idiots who can't think for themselves. I didn't even buy the call of duty this
year, which breaks my 7 years streak.

I didn't particularly care about the scenario; it's all the usual bad russians
nonsense. But I liked to play it competitively. I was good at it. I think.
Now, I kind of feel stupid for playing it.

Today is 23rd of February and it's the "protector of the motherland" day in Russia.
As military service is compulsory in Russia, we have this old holiday in there,
which celebrates everyone who served in military. My older brother did. And he
doesn't laugh in a circus anymore.

I didn't serve. I turned out to have a flat foot, which made me exempt from a
draft. But, I was one of those egg-headed kids. I spent my high school years in
a para-military foster house for gifted kids. Yeah, I had spent a few years in
barracks where almost every day included 6-7 hours of math + physics. Fun times.

But, I still remember the great pride Russians take in military. This great
image they have in their minds that military is the tip of the spear. That only
the best kind of people end up in military. And as stupid egg-head without parents
I wanted to serve. I seriously considered it as a career at some point. Couldn't
pass the health bar though. Thanks God, Mom, and Dad for my flat foots! A good
pair of Nike's makes it completely unnoticeable those days.

You can probably see where the Ender's game strike a chord in me. But, I'm a bit
different person now, and I can recognize the taste of the same post Roman Empire
bullshit I was fed as a kid. It is the same romanticized, alfa-male driven
"oh i'm so lonely in my leadership" crap people still find tasty.

It doesn't matter on which side of the border you are. It is always the same
story, people are marginalized, ideas and thoughts are demonized, nations are
diminished. It is the same type of control framework everywhere, and you're a
total chump if you buy into it.

The book is really well written though, and absolutely deserves its popularity.
