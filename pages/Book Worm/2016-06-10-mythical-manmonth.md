# Book: Mythical Man-Month

I keep forgetting to write about this book. So, I'll just put down some notes
here, because the book is kind of good and worth mentioning.

This is a classical work on software development teams efficiency. And it is
pretty good at outlining problems dev teams have and why you can't throw more
people into the fire to make things happen quickly. The book is dated though.

The whole thing is actually a huge rant about communication overhead in knowledge
workers space. It is not wrong, but it keeps ranting, overconfidently, about the
same issue over and over again. And it doesn't really tell you what to do to fix
the problem.

As someone who optimizes development teams for living, I find it a bit amusing.
Yes there is a communication overhead and you need to be well aware of it. But,
it is not an actual problem on its own. Optimizing communication overheads is
a must have, but that's just a physical limitation on the size of teams.

Even if you increase a headroom, it still will be there. The most important part
of an efficient team is not the headroom itself, it is what they do to feel the
space before things start to break. You can have the most efficiently communicating
team in the world and still ship shit. I've seen this happening many times enough.

And in this regard I find this book a bit misleading. Unless you're in a very
old-school corporate space, teams sizing is a well solved problem. You still
need to understand the principles of it, and this book is a good intro into
the problematic of it. But, don't let it leave you with an impression that this
will solve _all_ your problems. This is just the beginning.
