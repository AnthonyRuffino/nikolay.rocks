# Book: Sophie's World

So, I haven't been reporting my book readings lately, but here is a good one.
Ever wanted someone to explain things to you like you were a 15 years old girl?
Well, here is your chance. Someone wrote a pretty cool book about the history
of philosophy that does precisely that.

Life can feel too long and unbearable. But it is also quite short relatively to
the history of the humanity. Which means you don't really get to experience the
entire evolution of thought. You might pick a few things here and there, but it
is very hard to grasp the entirety of the self understanding journey our species
went through in the last 5 thousand years. The sheer ambiguity of the task is
enough to just bail and live your life randomly, as it comes.

But this is important. This maybe the most important thing out there. If you
can't grasp the last 3000 years of evolution of philosophy to understand why
thing they way they are, you're pretty much doomed to live a reactionary life.

Consider this as a dictionary problem. You can't express and reason about certain
things in life unless you have a vocabulary for it. The same way you can't fully
appreciate neither science nor poetry until you understand where both of them
came from. Same goes for freedom, equality, self-reliance and many other pretty
important things.

Well, there is a book out there that does a very god job at explaining the history
of human thought, from Democritus to Sartre. It will get your head spinning in
no time!
