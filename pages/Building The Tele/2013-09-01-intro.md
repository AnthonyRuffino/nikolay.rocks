# Intro

Long time ago, back in Siberia, I had a little workshop and used to build guitars. I came from rather technical background and always enjoyed to build stuff with my own hands, and building guitars was something rather special, something out of the reality distorting area. You start with an ugly log and end up with something that sing and roar and can rock the world.

Anyways, it was something I really loved to do, and something I really missed through my years of wandering in the world. And long story short, I decided to build a telecaster out of spare parts bought on ebay.

This project will take couple of months and has a goal to build somewhat good for blues tele with rather modern look. In any case, I just wanna document the process and write some guitar stories along the way.
