# The Body

For this project I bought a nice, official fender custom shop body. As I'm building a tele for blues, I picked a medium weight swamp Ash body.

Tele bodies are made from all sorts of materials, normally it's either ash or alder, but often they're made of pine and even rosewood. The principle here is rather simple, the heavier the body the darker the sound and the other way around. Ash is somewhere in the middle and considered to be the "standard" wood for fender guitars. It also comes in different grades, from light 4lb (1.8kg) for country, up to 6+(~3kg) which go more for rock and punk music. I normally just screwing around with blues, so I picked a body that weight ~5.2lbs, which should still have enough of middle tone, but be dark enough to go nicely with light overdrive.

The body itself is three years old and very nicely built in fender's custom shop. It is a rather cheap one, but if you know where to look, you can see that the work they've done is pretty admirable. It's all in the details, how they pick pieces, how they glue them together so that the grain between pieces match, etc.

They even painted it a bit differently on the sides. They used the semi-transparent, butterscotch blond paint, which I tend to really dig, it's yellow, but it's not cheap yellow like some mexican tele and it's not completely pale like some american ones. In any case, paint gets absorbed differently on different cuts of wood and if you just airbrush it in once coat, as cheap guitars done, it looks a bit ugly on the radial cuts on the sides, so they had compensated for that and gave it a bit of  extra coating on the sides, so it looks really nice.

Overall it's not just a CNC milled piece of random wood from an express vacuum dryer. This thing went through the whole process, judging by the stamps on the body, it took them ~3 years to build it and although it's obviously not the best in the world, this thing obviously got some love and I really dig it.

Can't wait to see how furniture will look on it!
