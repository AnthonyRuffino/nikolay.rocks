# Colemak The Beginning

Long story short, I've decided to learn the [colemak](http://colemak.com)
keyboard layout. And being so, I'm starting a new section in my blog where I
intend to post updates on my progress.

So, you might ask yourself, why learn new keyboard layout, and why #colemak?
Well, I kind of was curious about keyboard layouts. I learned two Russian keyboard
layouts early in the days—which is completely different from English—and I also
work every day on a standard PC layout. So, you can say I was pre-exposed to
the concept.

I also was aware that the QWERTY layout was invented in the days of the mechanical
typewriters with a completely different than typing efficiency idea in mind.
One of the anecdotes say that it was created so you could easily type the word
TYPEWRITER on the top row of the keyboard, so that it would be easier to demo
the product by untrained personal. lol

I've heard that in modern days there were attempts to make the layout more
efficient. At some point I considered the Dvorak layout, but it always turned
me away because all the keys are in wrong places for all the app shortcuts.
Simplest things like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, would be completely messed up. More of that
all the punctuation is also in wrong places to perform my software developer
duties. So, I kind of saw the benefits of switching, but it was completely
unrealistic for my occupation.

Then a friend of mine [Nikita Vasilyev](https://twitter.com/elv1s) said that
he switched to something he called "colemak". I got curious and started to research
the topic and it turned out in 2006, one smart guy invented a new keyboard
layout which is derived from the standard QWERTY.

There are a bunch of differences between dvorak and colemak. One, and most important,
that is _derived_ from QWERTY. Meaning most of the ZXCV and punctuation keys
are in the same place and won't screw up my programming work. Secondly, unlike
dvorak that was created by a human, colemak was created on a computer by running
statistical analysis to optimize it specifically for English. Apparently it is
marginally more efficient than dvorak.

So, a promise of better efficiency + standard punctuation keys made me to decide
to give it a try. Either way I believe learning new mechanics will be good for
my brains anyways.

To be somewhat sciency about it, I established my current typing speed in QWERTY,
which is more than humble 55wpm. I feel that it is quite slow due to the new
MacBook 12" keyboard, but, I'm not gonna change in it the near future, so the
experiment should be more or less clean.

Well, that's about it. I'll try to post updates on my progress semi-regularly
in here, so watch out for new posts!
