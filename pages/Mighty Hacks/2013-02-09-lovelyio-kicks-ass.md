# LovelyIO Kicks Ass

In case you're not up to date with what's going on here. [lovely.io](http://lovely.io) is an HTML5/CSS3 centric fork of the [rightjs](http://rightjs.org) project, which is basically a #javascript library that was aiming for speed and novelty.

So, when I started with #lovelyio, one of the things that was bugging me all the time was an aim to make it faster than #RightJS. The problem as you know is that #rightjs, due its unusual dom-wrappers based architecture, was the number one for several years in terms of dom-manipulations speed.

TL;DR, finally I've made some progress in this area, and lovely.io is now consistently faster than the latest #rightjs build by ~5-10%. Not much, but it's an obvious win.

As per usual, one of the perks of making things better is that you can troll #jquery folks.

Hey jQuery robots! Did they tell you that jQuery 1.9.1 is better than jQuery 1.8.2? Well it aint :)

Yes, I said "troll", so that you could chalk it up on me and don't feel bad about your framework of choice. But if you want to know what's going on, you can find the source code of the tests over here
