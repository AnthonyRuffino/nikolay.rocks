# Building Street Fighter II in Ruby

A few weeks ago, I decided to stretch my #gamedev chops a bit and
built some basics of the Street Fighter II game in #Ruby. That turned
to be more fun than I expected, so, I also recorded a short video
that goes through the main steps of the process.

The game is not fully finished at the moment, I had just put in some basic
implementation of the main game scene, controls, animations etc. I pushed
it all to GitHub [MadRabbit/ruby-fighter](https://github.com/MadRabbit/ruby-fighter),
so if you feel like playing a gamedev as well and give it a go, it's all there!
