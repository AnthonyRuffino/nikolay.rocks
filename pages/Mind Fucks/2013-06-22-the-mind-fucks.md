# The Mind Fucks

It's might be a bit strange hobby for a programmer, but i dig psychology, cognitive science and meta-thinking in particular. It's just professional interest, programmers are basically mental heavy lifters and understanding how my own brain works is kinda fascinating.

So, I'd like to start a new log, where i could occasionally write about all those little things software-developers often unaware of. Well, until some point in their life anyways. And I'll start with the good old one.

# The Dunning-Kruger Effect

This is really simple. The Dunning-Kruger Effect describes inability of a person to adequately estimate his own abilities/skills in tasks in which they don't have enough experience. Basically, most of the people overestimate their skills when they're moderately good at something.

In case of software developers it's always turns into the well known "4-years old syndrome". Developers are generally smart guys and it takes them ~2-3 years to grasp the basics of computer science, and 1 year after that they tend to fall into the "know it all" stage.

The problem is that learning is not a linear process as it might appear. If it takes you 2 years to get from a junior developer to mid level one, you might think that it will take you another 2 years to get from mid to senior, and then 2 more years to the elite super-hacker level.

Knowledge and learning is much like speed of light. Every next step requires more energy and takes longer, because the further you go, the heavier you get. And sadly, sheer knowledge is not the only thing that counts in our profession, in fact it's more like a prerequisite. Experience and talent for elegant solutions, that's what really matters. And gaining experience takes time.

## How Not To Fall For It?

Aside of understanding the problem, there is one really good solution for this fallacy that was known for ages. It's called

> Get your ass kicked

Start ambitious projects, compete agains other fellow developers, always ask superior folks to review your code and ask them not to be nice to you.

And as it often happens after collision with the reality, you will get hurt, you will get disappointed, but you will recognize the problem, and that will make you truly better.
