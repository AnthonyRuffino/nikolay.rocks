# The 90 Seconds Thing

In some ways, writing code is much like driving a sport car. It might look relatively simple, but if you don't know what you do you'll just make a lot of noise and will drive from border to border. Writing good software is hard, it takes lots of practice, and sometimes you need to drive into a corner sideways to make it right.

The thing is, that writing code is a skill, good programmers fall into some sort of stasis when they write code. Just like driving a car, you feel in control, you know what you do, but after the job is done, you sometimes can hardly recollect how you got from point A to point B. Programmer's mind constantly processes information at high speed and at any given moment makes gazillion decisions.

This is a well known problem in sports and cars driving in particular. In many cases, your brain is so overwhelmed with processing the data, that it can't make conscious decisions effectively. To overcome this problem, they use all sorts of meditation techniques. Basically drivers visualise the road in their minds and imagine themselves driving it, they go through that complicated corner over and over again in their minds until their subconsciousness memorises the pattern. Later, when they drive on real road, their bodies already know what to do and they can focus on other things, like competitors, weather conditions, etc.

If you ever watched really good programmers you might notice they do similar thing. When they're given a new task, they stop, freeze for a minute and then start write the code from top to bottom in basically one set. Those hackers do this premeditation thing naturally, they think the thing through, outline what they're going to build in their minds before they write the code.

In psychology it is a well known effect, it takes ~90 seconds for you brain to make a judgement, everything else is usually negotiation and rethinking on that decision.

So, next time, before you jump into madly writing code, stop for 90 seconds, let your brain to process the task first. It will do two things for you.

1. It will help you to visualise what you're trying to achieve
2. It will trigger your quick judgement reflexes before you make a mess

Trust me, 90 seconds is nothing comparing to hours of building and reworking the things a wrong way.
