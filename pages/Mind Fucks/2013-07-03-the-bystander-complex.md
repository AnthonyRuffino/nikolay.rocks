# The Bystander Complex

There is a really good reason why otherwise intelligent people do really stupid things when you bring them together. There is this little thing called conformity.

Every separated person might be intelligent and independent thinker with his own opinion on a whole range of things, but when you a bring a bunch of people like that together, conformity kicks in. It is a natural, subconscious reflex that used to keep groups of people together and therefore increase their chances on survival. No matter how intelligent or opinionated, in groups, people instinctively tend to conform with the group interests. Especially in unusual and doubtful situations.

Bystander complex is a direct result of the group conformity instinct. There is a whole bunch of cases through the history when people were murdered and robbed in a broad day light with dozens of eye witnesses, and no one did anything. It's not that no one wanted to help or was too afraid, those situations happen because in unusual circumstances every person checks with the reactions of people around them, and if they don't see other people do anything, they tend to keep calm and comply with the group behaviour.

You might think that software developers are better than that, that if we want we can fix anything. Reality is that conformity and bystander complex are very common among programmers as well, especially in world of open-source. I'm sure you know a whole bunch of cases when really bad decisions were made by some really bright folks, and you might even thought

> This thing is horrendous, I'm pretty sure someone will jump in and fix it pretty soon.

The trick is, everyone thinks that. As the result, it is very often case that a few folks raise their voices but no one acts and the group starts to think something like

> Oh, no one fixed that, maybe that thing is ok. Maybe there is a reason why it's like that and we should all use it.

And the larger the group of people, the better chances that you get into this situation. (Yes #rails turbo-assets-super-line I'm looking straight at you).

So, the moral is pretty obvious. If you wanna have better things, just go in and try to fix it, don't wait for the group approval, coz that might never happen.

Also, take large and popular projects with a grain of salt. People in groups tend be polite and please each other with good words, it's just what we humans do, and often it doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the project that unites us.
