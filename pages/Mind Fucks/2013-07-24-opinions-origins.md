# Opinions Origins

Sometimes it's almost seems that our entire industry is driven solely by opinions. So, here is a little theory about opinions.

In good old times, there were two types of monkeys, one could see a sable-tooth tiger's tail sticking out of a bush and picture the rest of the beast hiding behind the leaves, and the other type of monkeys would saw raw facts (meaning just the tail) and didn't jump to conclusions.

As you might imagine for millions of years, the first type of monkeys would run for it, and the second type of monkeys would be eaten systematically. As the result, our brains evolved to think about things in a very specific way. Our brains don't think logically, our brains think associatively and most of this thinking process happens in the subconsciousness.

That's why people are often irrational. Because we don't go through the `if|else` constructions in our heads. Well, we could if we really needed, but in most cases we just get existing associations in our memory, and try to pull something out of it. And if a person had weird, conflicting experiences he will get weird, conflicting associations out if it.

More of that, when it comes to memory, we all are subjects to what's called the consistency bias. Basically when something doesn't add up, instead of facing an internal conflict, we tend to just go ahead and invent stories and memories to keep the picture consistent.

As the result, practically all our opinions are delusional one way or another, and just as in the case of tiger's tail, opinions are often provoked by insecure feelings.

So, next time you hear someone saying "in my opinion ..." you should really hear something like "here's kind of associations i've got it my head" and then think of experiences this person went through, that might just tell you more on the topic than the opinion itself.

Oh, and if you see an "opinionated framework", stop for a moment and think why is that the authors felt so insecure and put the word "opinionated" in the first sentence of the project's description. And why authors are trying to put those opinions on framework itself rather than express them personally?
