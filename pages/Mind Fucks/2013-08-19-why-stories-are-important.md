# Why Stories Are Important

There is this thing called "narrative psychology", which basically postulates that everything that humans do and think and understand are stories. Even your whole personality is a story which you tell yourself every day.

You know by now that human brains are basically huge association machines and we don't really think things through logically bite by bite, instead we make associations. The funny thing is that we don't use plain associations either, we make little stories out of them. And the story must make sense. Well at least to you personally.

Stories are the way we make sense out of all the chaos that happens around us. All the statistics and numbers live in the realm of dry science, it's us, humans, who give them meaning through narratives. In fact this idea is so popular, that it was abused for centuries in all the mystery novels and detective movies. Take any of them and there is always a sequence of seemingly random events  and it takes a genius to put things together and make sense out of it. And you know it, detective always tells a story before pointing his finger to a culprit.

You might not write a novel in your code (although you totally could), but making your code to represent a story is a straight forward thing to do if you want your code to be easily understandable and hence maintainable. It is not enough to just break your code to pieces, it is important that abstractions you use were at the same level of the story and hence make sense to the reader.

And same thing goes for the tests, if your tests are just a random pail of cryptic constructions, you do it wrong, even if you have 100% test coverage.

Good code reads as a good story, you just jump in, read it through, and get it all after one pass. Loud and clear.
