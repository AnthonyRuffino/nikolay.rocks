# Programmers Happiness

Happiness is an elusive topic, but mechanics of it can be explained through memory. See you have two types of memory, sensorial memory, which handles things like touching, tasting, sense of spacial orientation, etc., and conscious memory which basically handles memories of events, places you've been, people you've met.

The first type of memory lasts for about a minute. After that can only partially recollect it in the long lasting memory as a series of echoes and events. The second type of memory is persistent and lasts for days, months and even years, depending on the importance of the event.

So, when it comes to happiness, it's like there are two different people inside of you, struggling for getting what they want. One is a long term planning person that say wants to loose weight, but another one kinda wants a piece of cake.

This struggle is going on and on inside of your brain every second. You can focus on one half of them, say you want to travel and save money, but then you go and work for some faceless bank. You can do that, but that will make you half happy, half miserable, which is kinda 0 in the end tally.

The real trick is not in finding a compromise, but in finding something that will make both of the types of memory satisfied. Like great creative job that's paid nicely, or tasty healthy food.

This is one of the reasons, why languages like #ruby or #javascript are so popular. They have little overhead and easy to maintain, but at the same time allow you to tackle pretty ambitious tasks.

So, as a programmer, you always need to keep those two sides of you in mind. Be creative and ambitious in your work, but keep it tidy and easy to maintain. Make implementation plans, but write scripts to automatize routine tasks as well. That's all there is really.

And the best part is that this approach comes with a bonus. Life is sooo much better without inner conflicts! And you can spend all this extra energy you usually spend in struggles, on living the life. You can walk with a doggy on a beach, give hugs to friends, see places, ride a pony. Well, you get the picture.
