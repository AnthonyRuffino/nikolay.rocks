# Self Imposed Rules

There is this thing people do a lot, it's called "self imposed rules". In sports and competitive games it is a well known factor. The classical example would be when someone calls another one "cheater" and they create all those extra rules to make the game "fair".

The hard truth is that there is no concept of "fair" in life. There is a game and you're free to use any moves that are allowed by the game rules. That's how we determine the winner.

Unfortunately not everyone is a winner and some people are trying to bend the rules so that it looked like they gave it the best and hence if they lost it wasn't their fault, it was a flaw in the game.

In sports they call those people "scrubs", people who scrub the floor after the game is over.

And programmers do that all the time. All those talks about superiority of one technology over another, sql vs. nosql, the modern tendency for functional programming purity, hate for not your favorite programming language or a database. Those are all classical examples of self imposed rules.

The name of the game is "build a product", and if you're complaining about technology not being the ideal, you're not playing it to win. Just as any other scrub on the planet, you are bending the rules so it would look like you gave it the best and if things weren't built it wasn't your fault.

Reality is, it is your fault, and the only question that really matters is what you're gonna do about it?
