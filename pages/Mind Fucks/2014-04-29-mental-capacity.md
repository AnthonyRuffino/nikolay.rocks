# Mental Capacity

We programmers are the smart people, right? It is fundamental to our believes that in the virtual world, with enough hardware and coffee, everything is possible. And while i wholeheartedly believe in it, i also believe that it is crucial for a developer to take the idea of mental capacity seriously.

You need to realize that you not only limited by the number of hours in a day, but also in the number of logical operations your brain can perform per a quantum of time. When you realize that, the immediate thought that comes after it is "how do i trim the waste?".

There are plenty of ways you can go after it, but today i'm sharing a simple trick that i was taught years ago and which i personally find really helpful. It goes like that

> 1) Don't think about what you don't like
> 2) Focus on what you're after

Sounds dumb simple isn't it? Well, why don't you do it then? Just cut down hatery, stop complaining about other languages, buggy libraries and lack of tests in your current project. Reuse all those wasted brain cycles to create something and change your world for better. Well, because you can!

And it has a hidden bonus. It will make you a more cheerful and huggable person as well.
