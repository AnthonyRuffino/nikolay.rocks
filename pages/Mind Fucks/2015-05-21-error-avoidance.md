# Error Avoidance

The fun thing about humans is that, in pretty much any situation, you can characterize their behavior based on two simple instincts: they will avoid pain and they will seek intense pleasure. Well, the lengths at which a person will follow those instincts may vary, which brings us to the today's topic.

Error avoidance is a result of a completely natural reflex of pain evasion. I'm sure you saw it yourself many times "oh no, i've made a mistake, i'm a disgrace to my family!", "oh, my thing segfolted in production, i probably should quit programming". People generally don't like making mistakes, the consequences can be painful. So, the natural response is to avoid pain and make as few errors as possible.

Now, while there are, in fact, cases in life when you need to be extremely cautious and make as little mistakes as possible. Say, you are performing a brain surgery, or transferring some one's life savings to another bank account, or programming a self-destruct sequence on a nuclear war-head. Yeah, you need to be damn sure you didn't make any errors. But, in the overwhelming share of cases, all your mistakes will lead to is embarrassing. Which exists pretty much in your head only.

The reality is, errors are necessary for growth. Every error is an opportunity for you to understand your shortcomings and improve your skills. There is no substitute for it. Errors are vitamins and micro-elements of your personal growth nutrition system. Remove those from you diet and you will rob yourself of reaching your true potential.
