# Prototype Matching

Prototype matching (don't mistake with prototype modeling) is one of
the techniques in the decision making theory. Basically, it is a bit of a
mind hack that helps to make a decision in a situation when differences
between options are not so clear or incomparable directly to each other.

The principle goes something like that. When faced with options that
are unclear or hard to compare, instead of trying to make lists of
pros and cons, and compare apples to oranges, it can be more efficient
to think of archetypical people who would pick each of the option.

For example, lets say you're thinking _"should i learn ruby or javascript?"_,
you might imagine two dudes: one is bearded and knowledgeable, but dislikes
everything non-ruby; the other one might be young, a bit sloppy and naive,
but have an open mind. You obviously can think of a female developer if you
want, the point here is to imagine archetypes that make sense to to you
personally.

Then, once you have those archetypes, instead of focusing on comparing
ruby to javascript directly, try to think to which of those two archetypes
you relate more. The one you feel more connected to, will most likely be
associated with the better option.

The science of this technique is basically in cognitive dissonance
minimization. It helps you pick the option about which you care more
deeply. In a long run that might be just the only thing that matters.

So, the next time you choose a language or ask yourself whether you
should work for a company `A` or a company `B`, try to think of some
associated archetypes. After all the company won't become like you,
you will become like them; so, try to pick what is connected to your
sense of yourself better.
