# Learning The Right Lesson

I quite like #chess. I'm not particularly good at it, but I like it for a very
specific reason. It teaches me how to think, how to learn and how to adapt.
You see, chess is kind of like life, or space if you will. It's practically
infinite in its complexity. So, no matter how smart you are, it got you covered.
There is some weird calming thing to it.

We understand life by seeing patterns in it. Some specific situations that
repeat themselves in one way or another. Over time we learn how to scope a series
of events into something we can call "a situation". And we try to analyze those
"situations", learn what they mean.

And then we gradually move down that line from patterns to situations and from
situations to singular encounters. And, as we are moving through those layers
of understanding, our interaction with those layers shifts from analysis to
learning and then from learning to reflective actions.

The interesting thing happens when we become subjects to unpleasant or traumatic
encounters. Say you are a kid and you eat stuff you were not supposed to â€“ you angry
your parents. Or you stick a piece of metal into a power socket and you get zapped.
Or you raise your concerns at a company meeting in a rather rumbling way and get
fired.

What it shows you is that being in those situations is, well, unpleasant. So,
naturally the lesson a person learns from them is not to get in those situations
again. Which, turns out, is actually the wrong lesson to learn.

Chess puts a really nice frame around this. See, you can do the same thing in
chess as you do in life. You get into a difficult situation and you can learn
to avoid this situation in the future. But then, pretty quickly it turns out,
you can't get very far in chess by being avoidant. It is a confrontational game.
The whole gameplay revolves around putting an opponent into a difficult situation
and then taking advantage of it.

So, what you learn in chess pretty quickly is that instead of learning how to
avoid difficult situations, you need to learn how to handle them better. That
what makes you stronger; that what makes you a better player.

I believe the same principle applies to life in general and software development
in particular. Some snarky person once said that programming is like being sad
for money. This demonstrates the issue very nicely. There are so many developers
who just constantly hate buggy libraries, legacy code and dumb management. And
they avoid them as a plague. But then, years pass by and they stay in the same
tarpit they were before.

In a way it is an equivalent of a fair weather sailor; call them fair library
programmers if you will. The underlaying problem is the same, they learned the
wrong lesson from the difficulties of the trade. Instead of learning how to fix
buggy libraries, how to work effectively with legacy code and communicate with
management, they just keep hating and avoiding the problems. It might look cool
on twitter now and then, but it doesn't get you anywhere.

You drift in this plateau because you learned the wrong lesson from difficult
situations. Instead of learning how to deal with them in a better way, you
learned how to avoid them all together.

Which kind of puts you intellectually into the same league with an 8yo kid
sticking a metal fork into a power socket.
