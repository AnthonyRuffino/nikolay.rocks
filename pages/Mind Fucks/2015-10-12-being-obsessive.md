# Being Obsessive

So, here are three, easily reproducible, steps how to make your life miserable
and how to make your friends hate you:

1. Take on a challenging task
2. Freak out
3. Start obsessing about minor details

This pattern gets repeated in different forms quite often. And, interestingly
enough, humans rarely recognize it from within their own point of view. Well,
until it is not shown to us.

It is a result of a bad coping habit. That is how our brains wired, it is all about
control. See, when faced with a difficult task, we often feel like it is all
falling apart, like we are loosing control. And what our brain does is that
it quietly shifts into trying to manipulate easily controllable things. It is
a way of dealing with the unpredictability of the outcomes of the original task.

It feels natural, _"i'll try to control what i can"_. So, in a difficult situation
we tend to think that it is the right thing to do. But it is actually a self
defeating strategy. You mangle with minor details while your primary challenge
falls apart from a lack of your attention.

I find this case fascinating. Learning computers is a relatively easy thing.
Figuring how to use your brains to apply the knowledge can be not so obvious.

So, here you have it. The next time you find yourself obsessing about syntax
or software design patterns correctness, ask yourself _is that a result of
you coping with a difficult task?_. And if so, you probably want review your
approach to the whole thing and direct your energy where it actually matters.
