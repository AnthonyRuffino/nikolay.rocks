# Defensive Ego Projections

I am kinda excited about learning this one. Have you ever seen a person saying
something like "I don't care who you are, if you don't write tests you are not
professional!"; or say you were mangling with MongoDB and someone said "did you
try /dev/null?"; or, my favorite, "eww, javascript!". Of course you have! Wanna
know why people do that? Keep reading

I find minds fascinating. It's nothing really like a computer. It's more like
a front-end, back-end and a database; pardon my frivolous interpretation.

One of the best descriptions of a mind we have at the moment has three parts to
it. The consciousness (front-end), that is what you think think you are. The
sub-consciousness (back-end), that is the actual thing you are, which feeds your
consciousness with ideas. And collective-consciousness (database), that is the
thing we were taught and which your sub-consciousness uses to make sense of
things in the world.

The consciousness you kind of can understandâ€”that is what you think you are. The
collective-consciousness you can kind of grasp as well as a collection of your
experiences and expectations based on your social context. But, what is
sub-consciousness really? How does it look and how do I poke it with a stick?

Well, sub-consciousness is kind of the weird part. That is where your emotions
and instincts live. It doesn't really communicate that well in words. More of
that, it constantly feeds your consciousness with lies and deceptions. It is so
good at it that you won't even notice its work unless you told where to look.

See, sub-consciousness, it doesn't like to be hurt and tries to protect you all
the time. It just wants you to survive (and maybe procreate). It tries to guard
you against your fears, unpleasant memories and cognitive dissonances.

You know how you look around and never seem to notice how you blink? Your visual
cortex makes it look like one seamless movie. Sub-consciousnes does a similar
thing to what you perceive as yourself. It patches your experience of existence
so that you didn't notice that there is something off the beam. I mean, you have
more interesting things in life than contemplating about an existential crisis
after all, don't you? So, how do you see it at work?

Well, in our pursuit to understand the human mind, we have figured this effect
called "defensive ego projections" or just "psychological projections". It works
kind of like blame shifting. Your sub-consciousness makes your consciousness
to think that you don't have certain (usually negative) traits, while at the
same time it attributes (or "projects") those qualities on people around you.

According to this theory, one's hate for people who don't write tests is actually
a result of this person's fear of inadequacy. It is their sub-conscious desire
to prove that they are tough professionals that makes them emotionally respond
to people who don't fit their image of an IT-professional. Same others might
have hate for, let call them "less adequate" programming languages. It is nothing
really but the reflection of one's fear that their programming language doesn't
make them special.

Wanna really piss off a ruby developer? Write something awesome in javascript! :)

Either way. That is a cool theory an it definitely helped me to look at my own
reactions and judgments more clearly and encouraged me to look of the answers
within. I hope it will help you too.
