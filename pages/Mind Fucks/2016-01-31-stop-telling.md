# Stop Telling Yourself Who You Are

I run. Not because I particularly love it, and I'm not a fitness monster either.
I just happened to have a neck injury that makes my life somewhat unpleasant if
I don't exercise. And running helps quite a bit. I guess I'm lucky this way.

But, running is actually quite interesting thing. Once you get over the initial
fitness barrier, it quickly becomes more of a mind exercise than body. Your
performance greatly depends on your attitude in a particular run.

For example, I've got this usual 5km route. It's a routine, I just get in, clock
the time, get out. I don't even think about it. But, sometimes I get bored.
Sometimes I want a bit of a challenge, so I'm taking a detour and making it into
a 7km run instead of 5. And here is where interesting things start to happen.

When you go there and you think something like: "ok 5km is easy, that's what I
usually run. So, 7 should be alright, just above that". This is a pretty natural
way of thinking about it. But, if you get on this path, when you get to 6th
kilometer you start to loose your energy; and when you get to 7, you're pretty
much giving up.

The fun thing is though, there is not much of a difference fitness-wise between
5 and 7km. It is the same category of effort actually. It's no brainer really and
anyone can see that. But, the moment when you start telling yourself: "here is
what I am and here is what I do", you set a limit on yourself. And your mind
will stretch to that limit; and the body will follow.

A much different story happens when you run without setting a limit. I've got
this other route, it's 10+ and can be extended even further. It actually has
plenty of hills and stairs in it, and a patch of a forest that looks pretty
scary at nights. But, I don't run it thinking "ok, 10km, but I usually run 5,
so it is a double of my usual norm, and can be challenging". If I get in this
mindset, I'll never finish it. Believe me I tried.

Instead, I think of it as a journey through hills and woods. I think that I will
run as much of it as I can, and if I can't, I'll just walk the rest of it. And
if I will be too exhausted to walk, I'll just take a bus. No judgement.

And, when I stop thinking about what I can and can't do, when I don't set a
definition of success upfront, and just focus on the running itself. In most
cases I can finish the whole thing. Even though there is a heart breaking 100m
elevation on 9th kilometer. When you don't tell yourself who you are, it becomes
just a run.

I tried this experiment many times. My results are weirdly consistent. So. I
started to look at other areas in my life where I do similar things. Apparently,
I do the same in technology. Every time I get to learn a new language and I think
to myself "oh, I know X, Y, and Z. so, learning W should be relatively easy",
I end up exhausted and frustrated.

But then, when you think about it. The fact that you know X, Y, and Z, has nothing
to do with W. It is not W's fault that you shot yourself in a foot with preconceptions
and expected W to be kind of like X, Y, and Z. Because, you know, they are all
turing complete, right?

Or, say when I read a book. If I feel that the book is too obvious to what I think
is my own understanding of a subject, I end up annoyed and frustrated. But, at
the same time, when I read a book that is obviously too trivial, but I don't
approach it with a preconception of leveling up, I actually pick up small and
useful things here and there. I actually learn things.

And then, I started to notice that other people do the same thing. I constantly
see developers thinking "oh, this language is far below my level of awesomeness",
and then they go on a whole circle of ignorance, self-denial and a struggle with
an imposter syndrome. Or a junior developer saying "oh, that thing is far too
smart for me, i'll just make a mess and everyone will think i'm stupid". And they
end up not growing as fast as they could.

Well, screw that! Seriously, life can be hard as it already is; and there are
plenty of other people who have nothing better to do than telling you what you
can and can't do. It is just silly to go and do it to yourself with your own
brains.

So, I'm quitting. I'm stopping telling myself who I am. Like on a principle. Ever.

It is surprisingly hard to do. Your whole self-identity is tied to this constant
stream of thoughts about yourself. Your stupid ego tries to keep itself consistent.
And the habit is so deeply rooted in your everyday existence.

But, it is rewarding too. You not always find pleasant things; sometimes it
is ugly and traumatizing. But, you start to notice things that all this time
were in your blind spot because you told yourself crap about yourself.

Like for example, I liked to think that I run because I have a neck trauma and
have to workout to ease the pain. And although it is technically true, when I
stopped telling this to myself, I realized that I actually like running itself.
Because I can challenge and explore myself this way. And staying fit keeps my
brains focused.

Well, I don't know what else to say here. I guess this is it: stop telling
yourself who you are for a day or two and see where it will lead you.
