# Being Wrong Is Awesome

Being wrong can be a hard work. I know this because part of my day job involves
basically telling people that they're wrong. Hence, I get to see this inner
struggle on their faces a lot. So, I thought I'd write about it.

Imagine you've build a web server. And, sometimes to figure some very complicated
things it makes a lot of requests to a database, and then maybe computes stuff in
memory. It is a very taxing process, so, naturally, you turn to caching and start
to stash repeating bits and pieces in a cache. Being right is kind of like that.

Being right is how our brains make sense of things. A brain like to have a pretty
and consistent picture of the world in a cache. Unfortunately, caching is a hard
problem. Because it gets out of sync with the reality. Being wrong is kind of
like that.

I know this because when I raise a difficult topic with someone, where they can
be wrong about something. In ~90% of cases I hear something that starts with:
"we always did it this way...". Caching is hard problem. If you start to rely on
it too much, you get burned. We all do. But, some of us take it to the heart.

The stupid thing is, being wrong is actually awesome. Think about it. If you
are wrong, it basically means you get to learn something. Even if later it turns
out that you were right all this time, you still can learn that you can be wrong
about specific topic. Where if you're right, you don't get anything. It just
tells you that your cache is still in sync; that's all.

Moreover, in a huge bulk of cases you're not actually wrong. In a huge bulk of
cases you just talk about different aspects of the same thing. Like for example,
someone says: "the new star wars suck!", and another one says: "actually, the
new star wars is pretty good". Neither of those two people is wrong. It is just
one of them is displeased that the new star wars is not the old one; and another
likes that there is a variety to the franchise.

You know, like a cached web page is rarely 100% wrong. It just missing a bit that
a specific person is looking for. Or it has and old bit that shouldn't be there.
It's not the end of the world. It's just fucked up cache. It happens. Because
caching is a hard problem.
