# Consider Intellectual Pain

There is this long lasting theory that human behavior and decisions, in all their
entirety, based on two simple factors: pleasure and pain. And, as a society, we
talk about pain a lot. We're so hung up about the ideas of physical and emotional
pain. There are thousands of books written on the topic, and billion dollars a
year industries created to remedy the human condition. Yet, we seem to never
talk about the intellectual pain.

Consider physical pain. It's pretty straight forward. If you hurt yourself (or
someone else does), most of us acknowledge the pain instantly. We go to a
doctor and they give us pills or what's not. We take proactive measures to
aid the pain, and we mitigate our condition in a constructive way.

Emotional pain is a bit trickier. Not everyone is aware of emotional pains. And,
as a result, not everyone deals with them in a healthy or even constructive ways.
The environment where you're growing will have a significant impact on this too.
Some people grow in emotionally healthy families and taught how to deal with their
emotions appropriately, some don't. I for example didn't.

I grew up in a dysfunctional family. I left my home when I was 14 years old and
spent my high school years in a foster house. Don't get me wrong, it's nobody's
fault and besides the point. But, when you weren't taught how to deal with your
emotional pain, you let it out in a rather destructive way. The common wisdom in
a foster house is that if someone threatens you, you go and kick them right
where it hurts.

The way out of it, is the same as with the physical pain though. You need to
stop pretending that you feel nothing. You need to understand that you're in
pain, acknowledge it, seek help, and take care of yourself. And, I think, we
need to do the same with intellectual pain.

But, i hear you asking right now, what is this intellectual pain, i keep talking
about? This's expected. Intellectual pain, same as emotional one is often times
invisible and unacknowledged by individuals. We keep acting on it by clinging
to our intellectual workers superiority macho BS, and ignore the fact of
the existence of the problem.

Let me ask you. What do you think you feel when you read a rather sub-standard
piece of code? Don't you feel a bit enraged? Don't you jump to the conclusion
that the author of the code must be a moron? That's your cognitive dissonance
in action. Your brain struggles to make sense of the world it's in. Your conciseness
is in an intellectual pain, and this pain emanates as anger through your emotions.

A lot of us software engineers grow up intellectually in the wilderness of the
open-source world. In my view, this is comparable to a kid growing up in a
foster house. We're taught by miserable superstars like dhh, zed, and such, how
to deal with our intellectual pains in an aggressive, snarky way. And we grew up
thinking that this is a norm.

Look at all those CSS and JavaScript haters on the Internet. We casually laugh
and give likes to their snarky comments, without realizing that by doing so, we
are perpetuating unhealthy habits of dealing with pain through aggression. In
other circumstances their behavior would constitute a plain case of bullying;
and we wouldn't be so inclined to laugh about it. But, we let it slip, because
nobody is talking about cognitive pains and healthy ways of coping with them.
It's basically invisible to us.

Some religious teachings have the concept of "discriminating knowledge". This
is the unshakable, ultimate kind of knowledge. The existence of God to a religious
person is _discriminating knowledge_. We understand that it takes a fair bit of
time and growing up for a religious person—or an organization—to become comfortable
with the idea that someone might disagree with this knowledge, and not wanting
to chop their head off as a response.

We, knowledge workers, need to do the same. We talk at length about diversity
and acceptance in our industry. Yet, when we have doubts of intellectual soundness
of people next to us, we get enraged and behave like uncivilized bunch of monkeys.
There's no excuse for such behavior. Same as with physical and emotional pains,
one needs to take responsibility for their intellectual pain as well.

Because knowledge is power, and guess what, power comes with responsibility.
