# "The" Colemak Problem and Workman

So, as I was continuing with my Colemak #keyboard layout journey, I discovered
a problem with the layout, that you might call "The" problem. Which consequently
made me to research #Colemak improved variations and led to the
[Workman keyboard layout](http://www.workmanlayout.com). But lets get to it
in order.

I kind of liked the first days on colemak, it definitely had a different feel
to it than QWERTY. Things were progressing smoothly, until someone pointed out
the following thing: try to type "The" on colemak and see how your hands move.
First you press the right shift with your pinky, so that your right arm moves to
the right a bit; then you press "T" (which is "F" in QWERTY), then you release
right shift and move your right hand to the left to press "h" (which is the same
"h" in QWERTY); and then you move the right hand to the right in the home position
to hit "e" (which is "k" in QWERTY). As a result the right hand makes this rapid
move to the right, then to the left and then back to the home position.

Now consider that this happens all the time "The", "them", "they", "other",
"weather", "together". Turns out "the" is one of the most common triplets in
English and when you write in Colemak, although you type on the "home row",
your right hand does this weird side to side movement all the time. Which kind
of really annoying and ruins the whole thing for me.

The thing is that Colemak was developed with two main ideas in mind: firstly,
move all the most frequently used letters to the home row; and secondly, reduce
the same finger movements to the minimum. It kind of does that brilliantly, but,
it doesn't count in your hands horizontal movements. Wicked, huh?

Well, turned out some pretty smart people were working on the problem. In 2010,
one of them developed a layout derived from Colemak, which he called "Workman".
And although workman was derived from Colemak, it was developed with a bit
different concept in mind. The guy postulated that vertical movements of your
first three fingers are not that costly as horizontal movements of a whole
hand or the point fingers. So, he developed his layout trying to reduce the
hands movements and the usage of the two middle rows (g, h in the standard
QWERTY). In onother words, he put the most used letters under the fingers of the
hands in the home position.

He actually assigned the "effort" cost on every button of a keyboard (there are
some cool diagrams on his site) and then was working from there. There are some
other ideas, like minimizing the business of the right pinky, optimization for
the most commonly known triplets and duplets in English, etc.

A bit of a drawback is that he moved the "c" and "v" letters a bit to the right.
Still reachable, but kind of painful a bit.

So, I decided to give a go and been practicing this layout for the last couple
of days. So far I like it, it feels as an improvement over colemak and delivers
some of the things that the author was aiming to reach. But, I think I need to
spend some more time with it to make my mind.

Well, that's about it. See you later.
