# The Rockstar Keyboard Layout, First Impressions

So, it's been couple of weeks since I thrown together the
[rockstar keyboard layout](https://github.com/MadRabbit/rockstar-layout). I can't
honestly say that I spent all this time on learning the thing. My work kept me
busy. Besides, learning a third keyboard layout in a couple of months span takes
its tall as well. Never the less, I learned practically all the keys in the new
layout and want to write down my first impressions.

A fair note. It is my own, custom layout. And although I didn't create the
initial letters disposition, I'm a bit biased here. So, take it with a grain
of salt. And a spoon of mayo.

As I mentioned before, learning the third new layout in a row turned out to be
a bit hard. My muscle memory gets confused a lot. So, the progress goes a bit
slower than with Colemak and Workman. Although, it might be an inherent quality
of this new layout as well, due to a bit different mechanics.

Generally, I feel a large difference between the Rockstar and Colemak/Workman.
It feels almost immediately as you start to learn the layout. Your hands alter
significantly more than in any other layout. And that creates a different
rhythm to the whole action. Because even if your fingers get into a slightly
awkward movement, it will most likely followed by a finger on another hand and
you will have more than enough time to recover.

Another thing that feels almost immediately is the very low penalty rate in this
layout. The same finger sequences are almost non existent. I could almost immediately
feel how much less my fingers are strained. Even comparing to Workman, which
already felt great comparing to QWERTY.

The weird thing that hit me at the beginning is the placement of the letters
`R` and `I` in the middle columns. Those are some of the most frequently used
letters, and relatively high cost positions. But, in reality, in this layout,
you practically never use the same fingers twice in a row. So, this placement
actually works brilliantly. You always have plenty of time to recover hands
positions.

Same goes for `D` and `H` being placed under pinkies. At the beginning it seemed
strange, `H` is not a vowel, why is it in the vowels row shifting the `I` in the
middle? But, turned out, `H` in English works a lot like a vowel in terms of its
alteration with consonants. So, it works great in the end and only helps hands
altering.

Overall, there is still a long road ahead of me in terms of mastering this layout.
But, I can tell right now, that this one feels like the best one I ever tried.
It requires work and relearning, but I really like the results. And I think
this is the one. This is the one I want to stick with and want to make it work.

More later!
