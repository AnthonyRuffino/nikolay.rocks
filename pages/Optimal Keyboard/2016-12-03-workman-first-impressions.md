# Workman, The First Impressions

So, it's been roughly two weeks after I had started with my
[Workman layout](http://www.workmanlayout.com) training. Time to put some of
my initial impressions into words.

Lets recap quickly on workman's principles, why this layout was designed the way
it is. One of the main goals was to minimize lateral movements of hands during
typing. And to achieve this goal, two things were done comparing to Colemak.
Firstly, the author reduced the usage of the middle two rows by placing rarely
used letters in there. Secondly, he didn't mind to sacrifice some same-finger
movements as he didn't see them as demanding as they are usually perceived.

So, I've learned most of the layout in those two weeks. At the moment I'm on
level 9 in [Type Fu](http://type-fu.com) (btw, the app is actually pretty good).
I don't know how much of it psychosomatic at this point, but I can confirm the
ideas. They work.

Even when typing long and complicated words, I don't move my hands or stretch
my fingers that much anymore. Usually when you go through a new layout training,
hands get soar pretty quickly, like I've been shredding on a guitar for a while.
In case of workman, I feel perceivably less strain in my fingers after exercises.
In most cases the rarely used letters that are placed in the middle rows ("b", "j", "k")
don't require the same hand action, so you have plenty of time to recover hands
position.

As for the same finger movements, again I can confirm, I feel like there are
noticeably more of them on workman than on colemak. Typing duplets like "hr",
"op", "po" and so on felt strange at the beginning as you have to do them by a
vertical movements of the same finger. But the thing is, I actually ended up
agreeing with the author, we don't type on mechanical typewriters anymore. On
a modern computer keyboard, this is not that big of a deal now. The presence of
those movements feel a bit weird at the beginning, but that is pretty much that,
a feeling of an unusual movement. Give it a few days of practice and they don't
bother you anymore. They are just as fast as alternating fingers.

Some of the movements are still a bit awkward though. Like for example "fl" or
"lf" where you have to jump between the top and bottom row. But, I guess you
can't optimize it for everything. I'm pretty sure I'll get over this as well.

Another interesting observation is that the workman layout actually works pretty
nicely with the most common tri- and bi-grams. For example take a look at the
heat map I've got from my training app:

If you would optimize for the most used keys to be in the home row, like Colemak
did. You would probably think that the letter "r" should be in the home row, as
it is clearly used really frequently. But, it is actually better to have it where
it is when you think of combinations of letters that you have to type. Turns out
the letter "r" is mostly typed independently, in conjunction with all sorts of
things; when the letter "h" is usually used with "s" and "t" which are right next
to it and allow rapid and quick combos.

The same goes for example for the letters "o" and "i". In colemak they are swapped
comparing to workman. And it kind made sense to me on Colemak. But then, it turned
out that we type "ion" really often in English. And typing them in a quick
sequential combo in workman is much easier than typing the same thing in a
shuffled order as it is done in Colemak.

Small and firstly unapparent things like that really make workman shine for me.
As for the negative side, the shifted "c" and "v" are actually quite a bit of
a pain in the neck. Look at this most frequent mistakes map:

See, where most of the errors happen? Turned out, the colemak people were right
about leaving those two in place. They are really hard to relearn. But, weirdly
enough, when it comes to typing the actual words, "c" and "v" feel more efficient
where workman had put them. So, I think I'll stick with it and try to learn those
two the right way.

Another a bit negative thing is that workman's community is kind of dead. It is
not really negative negative, it's more of a sad situation, because the layout
is a clear winner against colemak in my mind. But, because the author apparently
doesn't have a capacity to build a community around his creation, then workman
kind of falls into this category of esoteric things that exist only on your
computer. It is a great piece of work, but it is not a standard and probably
will never become one.

Well, that is all I have at the moment. If you have more questions, hit me on
