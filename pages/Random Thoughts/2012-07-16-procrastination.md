# Procrastination

Have you ever though why people procrastinate so much those days? I mean, sometimes it goes beyond ridiculous, you might spent 4 hours procrastinating over 20 minutes of work. And it's not like you're lazy or burnt out, you just can't focus.

I've got a theory that it happens because people's life doesn't depend on their immediate actions anymore.

See, at some point in the history of humanity, life started to be actually interesting. In good old days when people were running after each other with axes you could live till 30 and say "ugh, fuck it, i saw it all and it's all the same", but now, thanks to the marvels of technology, life changes all the time, human condition changes all the time and it's interesting what will happen next.

So, people started to want to see the future, people started to want to live longer, people started to value their lives more than anything else. And because of that, people started getting rid of everything that might have even a slight danger to life.

That's a good thing for sure, but it also removes the most powerful stimulus to be creative. Things people do those days are mostly far from being life threatening to anyone, so they think they have time. And because the law of minimal energy consumption applies everywhere, people don't do shit until it's getting critical.

The conclusion is simple. Wanna stop procrastinating, find something that's important, something that will change your life. That will keep you focused.
