# Be The Batman

I think most of sane people realised by now that invention of the Internet is the most important and profound thing that happened to humans. (yeah i'm going this way).

No, seriously, the previous undoubtedly â„–1 event was the invention of printing press. That allowed mass spread of information and changed humanity forever. The invention of Internet is the same thing, but gazillion times more powerful and hence gazillion times more important.

All, absolutely all future human endeavours will be based on the ability of people to communicate via the Internet. If tomorrow people invent a cure for cancer, that will be because of the Internet, if they kick Putin out of the Kremlin, that will be, non the less, because of the Internet.

Now my friend, think of it. What's the biggest drag on the Internet development? What stops this, the most important to the humanity thing to grow and reach it's potential at the moment?

That's the old Internet Explorer browsers. Not lazy ass sys-admins, not cheap skate company managers, not a god forsaken post office in the middle of Siberia with only one 20 years old IBM PC.

Now, you all been to the batman's movie, and you all heard the message "tolerant society is an excellent soil for parasitic crime types to grow".

No, i'm not agitating for burning Gotham City to the ground. I'm saying that you as a developer is socially responsible for the technology you develop. It's time to realise that civilians won't fight the crime. It's time to realise that we, the developers, are the police in this Browsers City, we are the vigilante, we are the batmans. If citizens of the city tolerate the old browsers, that doesn't mean they like it, that doesn't mean that old browsers are good for the society at all.

So, stop moaning "we have 10% of IE6 users"! Stop complaining that "the customer wants IE6 support"! Go out and kick the shit out of the parasitic browsers, that is your job and your responsibility!

And if you don't have the guts to do that, maybe you shouldn't be on the force in the first place?
