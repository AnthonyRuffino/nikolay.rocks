# Unhappiness

Okay, before we start a quick disclaimer, if you're getting through a rough patch or having some genuine bad stuff going on in your life, i might say some things that might sound offensive, don't take it personally. Those are just some silly thoughts that were nagging me for a while. Also, my condolences.

I believe that unhappiness is addictive. There are some legit cases for being unhappy about life, but I think 99% of unhappy people are just bitching about stuff and use it as an excuse for the shit they do.

You see, happiness requires strength and responsibility. Yeah, i know, it sounds a bit stupid, but if you think of it, the practice of being unhappy comes from childhood, if a kid smart enough and his parent care enough, the kid might realise pretty quickly that being unhappy is a good way to get attention or stuff he wants.

And that's really all there is about serial unhappiers, they grow up but still do this vicious cycle of shit: get unhappy, maybe someone will get you the stuff you want. And if you can't get what you want you always can keep being unhappy and use it as an excuse to get waisted, yell at someone or do whatever people normally do when they're unhappy.

The problem is that, this kind of shit doesn't make people happy, that's not even a point there. It's all about finding an excuse to do the easy thing. Coz happiness is hard, it requires work, achievements and discipline in what you want from life.

Yeah, i know, i talk silly, but I see it every day. Back in Russia it was like the whole god dammed country is like that: "yes we russians, we drink, coz life sucks and coz we're russians and nobody likes us". In reality that's a bunch of bullshit, if you don't wear babushka and don't eat borsch for breakfast no one give a fuck where you're from. After all we are all god's children, as the constitution says.

And it got even clearer when I got to the Thailand. You see, Buddhists they figured this stuff long before Romans invented Christianity. The rule number one is simple as that: "unhappiness is when you dumbly want stuff". And you can see it everywhere here. People at large don't wanna want stuff, they'd rather be moderate and happy.

As a rather radical example, there is a hobo lives down the street, every night he comes at the same phone booth next to a local 7/11 and sleeps there. So the other day I was walking home from that 7/11 with a pack of beers in my hands, and I was in a good mood, and I saw this dude making himself comfortable in the telephone booth. He never begged for stuff, always looked friendly and smiled, so i figured, I'll give him one of my beer cans, just to cheer up the dude a bit. Guess what, he didn't wanna take it. He smiled, bowed but didn't want to take it. Thanks god there was some security guard passing by, he translated that it was a gift not a dole.

Anyhow. Stop bitching, do stuff, get results, be happy.
Peace!
