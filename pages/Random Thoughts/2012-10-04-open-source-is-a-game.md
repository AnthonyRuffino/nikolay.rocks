# Open Source is a Game

Long time ago, when young Linus started hacking his first version of linux kernel, open source was like this little nerdy rebellion against corporate UNIX. And for a quite a long time it was the dominant idea, FSF meant OS, proprietary software companies fighted it then tried to lead it and everything looked exactly how it supposed to be.

Then open source stopped to be this Che Guevara fetish for computer science geeks, open source become a tool of professionals. Most of the modern frameworks, like Rails and Django were created that time. People found this simple model how to build high quality tools where everyone would benefit from their openness.

And as open source become a dominion of professionals, business immediately become interested in it, which consequentially brought attention of young developers to open source projects as a way to prove themselves  and therefore have better chances for finding jobs in future.

As the topic become hot, lots and lots of developers came to open source and now we find us in this situation when there are often too many contributors and gazillion clones of projects that do the same thing with minimal differences.

And you know what? I think open source at this point become some sort of a sport. It's not a rebellion against evil corporations anymore, more of that, it's not entirely about building something useful either, those days it's more like a competition for attention. Who gets more commuters wins the race. Simple as that.

And if you think about it, it's a good thing, revelating actually. If you get the constrains of building something useful off your shoulders, if you say forget about supporting old browsers, or stop worrying about compatibility, programming might be pretty fun thing to do.

You just need to stop pretending that you're saving the world by playing the game.
