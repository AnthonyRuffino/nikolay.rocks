# Programmer Happiness, Take Two

But seriously, despite my recent rant about programmer's happiness, i really believe that happiness is not a pill, but a life choice. And programmer's happiness is not different. I'm convinced that you can be happy and productive with any, most horrendous language, or a framework, or an environment. The other way around is also true.

It is a life choice, it is how you decide with yourself how you going to perceive things. It is the same way as you pick a partner in life, none of the rational and non-subjective metrics really matter, it's all about what you want and what makes you happy.

It might be hard at the beginning, and people can be real dicks about your choices sometimes. But hey, some people always will be dicks when you try to stand for something. That's how life lets you know that you're doing something right.

In any ways, I'm trying to say, that to be happy as a programmer, you shouldn't run after whatever is optimized for happiness, but work on how you approach things on everyday basis. Shit will happen regardless of your platform choice, and in the end it's all about how good you are at dealing with it.
