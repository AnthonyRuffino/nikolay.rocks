# The Year Of The Horse

It's probably a bit strange to write a year retrospective on a lunar new year, but I kinda missed the opportunity on the ISO new year, so I'll just pretend being fancy and do it now.


## Marriage

Well, there is no way around it (and there shouldn't be), the most important event of this year for me was my marriage. Long story short, I got married to a beautiful women, we love each other and so far it felt nothing but right.

It still feels a bit to early to contemplate on it in any meaningful way, so I'll just say, hooray to us!

## People Are What People Do

On the other hand this year was full of all sorts of realizations for me. There are good ones and bad ones, but one of the seemingly small and obvious, but, somehow very important, was that at some point I really felt it that people are what people do.

It doesn't really matter what you think about yourself from the inside of your skull in this regard, the things you do will affect who you are. People often neglect things they do (or don't do), or they often entertain the idea of being this and that, but don't really do anything.

Don't be an awesome person, do awesome things instead! You are what you do, so, shine!


## The Saddest Thing

A rather painful realisation was that one of the saddest things you can do to yourself is to let your limitations to define who you are. There are obviously things that you can't change, but surrendering to them without a fight to death is just... well, sad really.


## Shut Up And Learn

Another thing on the personal level that was hard to swallow, was a realisation that I grew too much into the development stack I normally use, and way too often I started to judge other tech from that stand point.

Well, it's easy to be a smug in your little domain, it's hard to look to things from a different perspective and try to really understand and get it. So, I started to punch myself in the face with books and throwing my brain into unfamiliar environments.

I learned a lot about business and management, I learned several new programming languages (including exotic ones like Elm and MiniKanren), I've spent some sweet time with Lua and Elexir, but the most notable was going with the 100% Swift and Xcode environment.

I spitted blood for a few weeks, but in the end, I learned to appreciate the other side of the world. Heck, I think i really like Swift and wouldn't mind if it was my primary language.

So, that was good experience, I hope I'll keep on this one in the next year.


## Travels and Journeys

It doesn't feel at times that this year was particularly full of travelings, but in reality there was a good measure of it.

Firstly, we went to New Zealand with my wife, that was awesome. A ~2000km roadtrip around the north island, with Hobbiton and the Tongariro national park. The place is amazing, would gladly go back! And certainly looking forward to go around the south island as well.

Secondly, my job send me on a couple of trips to the US and San Francisco. That was interesting. I think I enjoyed it a fair bit, loved the people as well. But was glad to be back to Sydney. I've got mixed feelings about US, so I'll just let it settle down.

Thirdly, we went to Fiji with my wife for our honeymoon. Interesting place actually, well, in its own way. I think at some point I want to see more of tropical islands in my future travelings.

## Looking Forward

Well, it was already quite a lengthly post, so I'll wrap it up here.

I have a few not so secret wishes for this year, but I don't wanna spoil them, so I'll sound them out in the next year summary I think.

Otherwise, we're looking good and the next year seems really promising, so I'll just try to work my ass off and see what will happen.
