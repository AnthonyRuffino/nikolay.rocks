# IELTS: Accepting The Defeat

In the past 5 months I did a strange thing, I attempted to pass
the [IELTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_English_Language_Testing_System)
exam with a minimal score of `8` (out of `9`) in every sub-task. I had
_7_ attempts and the best results look like that:

 * Reading   - 9
 * Listening - 9
 * Writing   - 7.5
 * Speaking  - 7.5

And, although it might look like the results are within a margin of
an error, I eventually decided to stop my attempts and let it go. And
this is basically the analysis (a.k.a "i learned a lot") post about
the experience I had with IELTS in Australia.

But, firstly, you might wonder why one would subject himself to a
such unusual ordeal. The answer in my case is: _"I wanna be free!"_.
I want to end the macroeconomic slavery period of my life and get a
permanent residency in AU. Unfortunately, due to some complications
with my background, I need to demonstrate a _superior_ level of the
English language skills.

Roughly 5 years ago, I took the IELTS exam in Russia. I did it almost
without any serious preparation, just for the fun of it, and I scored
7.5 on average. I figured that in those last years I have improved
rather dramatically, so, scoring 8, shouldn't be a problem. I expected
that I might need a few attempts, but, generally, it should be achievable.

Unfortunately, it turned to be much harder than I expected. I consistently
scored 8.5-9 in the reading and listening sections. But, when it went to
the writing and speaking blocks, the score was around 7-7.5.

It didn't make any sense to me. I know I have a 100% clear understanding
of whatever people say around me. I read compulsively. I actually
read faster than an average native speaker. I also present regularly
at meetups and conferences, and generally known for talking too much.
And, I write for living. So, why such a drastic difference between those
two groups?

Well, it turned out that the reading and listening sections have strict,
easily quantifiable ways to measure the results. They are actually checked
by a computer. Writing and speaking on the other hand are measured by the
"trained professionals". And, apparently, those professionals don't really
want us in here.

See, the only real reason why one would want to get a score of `8` in
IELTS here in Australia is that they want to immigrate. So, there is
a whole industry formed around it. There are a half a dozen of testing
centers only in Sydney. I've been to a half of them and they are packed!
This is ridiculous for a 5 million people city.

People are just thrown into this vicious cycle. In the last 6 months I
have heard countless stories about people who would score 8.5 in their own country,
but then barely scratch 7.5 here in Australia. Especially if you are an Asian
or an Arab. People spend literally years trying to get the score here in Australia.
Many Asian kids, they just fly back home to Vietnam or Hong Kong, to take
the test, because it is almost impossible for them to pass the bar here.

Well, I've heard the message. It's a clear "nope". And I don't really want to
play this game anymore. So, I'm sidestepping. I'll try to give my freedom
units to the American TOEFL test. Will see how that will turn out.
