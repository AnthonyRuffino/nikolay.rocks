# End Of The Year

Well, it is the time to continue my not so unique tradition to reflect a bit on
the year passed. Write it down and give my future self a bit of a reference.

It is a bit strange, I read sometimes my notes from past years. I kind of hope
to find that I grew up a bit in this year, got a bit wiser or something. But,
it rarely happens. Most of the times I just keep forgetting things I figured in
that year. So, it is good to remind myself about those findings. I guess.

Either way. This year was a bit hard. Hard on many levels, physically, intellectually,
emotionally. To not beat the bush around it, I almost reached the rock bottom.
My depression came back early this year and I had struggled for months. The
company I worked for failed. I lost friends. I missed the opportunity to
become a permanent resident in Australia the normal way. I had some hards with
my extended family members as well. Those things can take a tall on you.

But, you know what they say: what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I think
this year I really came to terms with myself that I'm not coming back to the
dark place. I don't want to live like that anymore ever again and I must punch
my way out of it. For good.

After a ~4 years break, I got back to weight lifting. Gained some kilos, from
77 to 82 to be precise. Then lost half of it, now putting it back. It's fun.
When you have muscles to keep you straight up, life doesn't feel that much miserable.

I've spent several months trying to pass the "exceptional English" bar at the
IELTS program. Didn't quite make it, sadly. But, I feel like I leveled up pretty
well. Also did some really good progress at TOFEL.

I didn't read as many books as I hoped this year. I went through a good couple
of dozens of them. I hope I will make better progress in the next year. I tried
to go through the speed-reading training, got to the 300wpm mark, but then slipped
off.

I also created several personal projects. Launched an app on iOS app store. Hit
the hackernews front page couple of times. Learned a lot. Also, abandoned several
projects as well.

I think I turned into a serial quitter. And a freaking slob when it comes to
personal projects. It was hard to accept that I lie to myself way too much. And
I push people away all the time. Stupid things, but it is so hard to understand
them on your own. Which makes them ever so valuable.

Either way, I think I more complain here than do something useful about it. So,
to the plans. Coz, fuck you God. If you decide to be an ass-hole and lough about
them, that is your problem. I'm gonna keep doing the things either way.

Well, thing number one is that I have to sort out my permanent residency in AU
before December 2016 or they kick me out. I was messing around this way too long,
now I just have to finish it up. Oh, and to the future myself, if you read this
past the next December and still haven't figured it out, fuck you too man. Seriously.

I'm also going to finish my English training and pass that bar. I don't care
how fair or unfair the system seems. This is an unfinished business and I'm
putting and end to it.

This is the theme I'd like to set for the next year: I'm finishing the things up.
Old scores, old projects, old books, trainings and stuff.

And one more thing. I really want to start surfing this year. I feel like if I
won't start now, it is not gonna happen ever. And, living in Sydney and not
surfing is like living in Russia and not drink vodka. If you know what I mean.
I have no idea how this will work out (guess we will learn in a year), but this
is something I wanted to do for a long time.

Either way, sorry if I sound a bit angry in this post. Because I am a bit angry,
mostly about myself, and I'm working on it. Wish me luck, and I wish you a very
happy new year and that it will be better on you than the last one.
