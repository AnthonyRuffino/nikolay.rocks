# You're Not Paid To Write Code

There is this anecdotal story about Ray Kroc, the founder of the McDonald. Once
he gave a speech to a bunch of students about business strategies and then he
asked them: "which business do you think i'm in?". At some point someone answered:
"flipping burgers, obviously". To which he said: "wrong! i'm in the real-estate
business".

See, although yes, technically McDonalds makes burgers. But, underneath that,
they actually own the hottest pieces of real-estate in every major city in every
country around the globe. And those properties appreciate like very few other
things on this planet.

We often think that our jobs as programmers is to write code. We argue about it
endlessly. Design patterns, test coverage, programming paradigms, syntax styles,
it's a whole world out there! And we are so fixated on it that we completely
forget that this is actually not what other humans are paying us for.

Lets face it, no one really cares about *code*. No one outside of programming
circles interested in syntax guidelines or cyclomatic complexity of your code.
Believe it or not, but humans are mostly interested in sharing pictures of cats
and the stock market prices. And you, as a developer is paid to produce a cheap
and reliable solution to that problem.

In the end, someone will take your code, market it, sell it and make some profit
on the margin. And the bigger the margin the more likely humans will do that all
over again. In this system there are only two real indicators that non-programming
people care about: how much does it cost to produce a solution to a user's needs
and what is the cost of introducing modifications when the user changes their
mind? That's it. We have invented the whole coding industry just to fit into
those constraints.

You are paid to produce *a solution* to a user's problem, and code is just a
byproduct of that process. Code itself is completely secondary. Once you have
figured a solution you can throw away the code and re-type it all over again in
a few days. That's why reverse-engineering is even illegal in most countries.

Imagine you have two old school hard-drives. One has the code and the other has
tests and documentation. Which one would you be willing to loose? Would you
prefer to have code that does god knows what, and the only developer who knew how
it works was hit by a bus? Or, would you prefer have docs and tests that describe
how a proven solution works?

Exactly.

All our efforts to improve test coverage and reduce overall system complexity
are actually shaped by the needs to produce cheap and reliable solutions to the
market needs. It is not about the code itself, it is about delivering solutions.

One could argue that the software industry at the moment goes through the same
phase as the automative industry had in the mids of the last century. We produce
gorgeous, powerful cars that are supposed to serve for decades and could be mended
by a half-whited mechanic in the middle of no-where. As developers we tend to
think that we have figured it all and we got good at it. But that's not going
to stay this way forever.

Eventually the industry will move on. Eventually we will start building cheap
and reliable toyotas that need minimum care and meant to be thrown away every
ten years. And then we will move onto building teslas where the only thing you
will have to do is to check the tires pressure. And that will be automated too.

I guess the point I'm trying to make is: stop fetishizing about the code. It
doesn't matter on its own. Burn your black t-shirt that says "developer + coffee
= code". Get a new one that says "I build reliable solutions to your problems".

As a developer you are not paid to lay down bricks of code from 9 to 5. You are
paid to find efficient solutions to users problems. Get good at it!
