# Welcome To The Shed

I'm starting a new section here called "the rocket shed". This
will be a section for posts related to my work on some of my
personal projects and probably some business related blabing.

There are few thoughts and stuff that I want to record as I go
through the projects. They are most likely will be rather technical,
but it is not for the tricks of the trade kind of posts that
I write in [Mighty Hacks](/categories/mighty+hacks).

The [Rocket Shed](/categories/rocket+shed) is where one steps
beyond mere technical abilities and tries to build an actual
rocket and see how high it will fly.
