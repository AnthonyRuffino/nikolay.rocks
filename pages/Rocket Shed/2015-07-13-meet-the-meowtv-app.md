# Meet The MeowTV App

A few months ago, my wife and I, we adopted a cat. Say "hi" to Muffin!

He is an awesome little dude. Being a digitally native cat, he just loves
playing with iPad. Initially he would spend literally hours playing with
some apps made for cats. But, as cats usually are, he soon would get tired
of playing the same game over and over. He needs some variety. And here
is where the interesting part starts.

Turned out that the market for apps for cats is really tiny. There is just
a hand full of apps that are worth checking in there. In a month he run
through them all and kinda got bored. Started to ask for more.

We have tried this and that, and accidentally stumbled on some videos
on youtube which are made specially for cats. The usual stuff, birds,
fish, squirrels. The problem is though, the YouTube player is made for
humans. Muffin would just get too agitated and start touching the screen
messing up the playback.

And here is where it occurred to me that cats need a special type of video
player designed specifically for their style of watching the movies.

Meet the [MeowTV App](http://meowtvapp.com)!

The concept is really simple. It is just as any other online video player,
you can search for some related videos, hit "play" and enjoy the movie.
But, the difference is that it has a transparent overlay that will lock
the video playback controls away from a cat.

The result is actually pretty awesome. The app automatically finds some
new videos for your cat to watch. There are literally dozens of them
online, so that provides a good variety. Then you can put the video on
a loop and lock the screen.

Works actually like a normal TV for humans. A cat gets glued to the
screen and can enjoy the movies for quite a long time. Well, that's pretty
much it. If you have a cat and an iPad/iPhone, give it a try, it's free
and awesome!
