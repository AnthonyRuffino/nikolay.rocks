# You aint no artist

I think programmers are often mislead into believing in their own artistic nature and then suffer from lack of ideal things in the world.

Yeah, software development does often need inspiration and lots of skill, but so does almost any field of work that involves creativity. And involvement of creativity doesn't mean art, coz one of the main distinct features of art is that it doesn't have any practical purpose.

See, if you would join a bunch of random jquery plugins so that they formed a face of a clueless hipster, that would be art. Coz the purpose of the construct would be to inspire and promote the idea. But if you're creating an actual app that has a real life purpose, then you're just a worker.

In most cases software development is not even an engineering, it's more like work of an electrician or a plumber. So, when a toilet doesn't flush and a plumber would go for several days on a search for an ideally shaped wrench made by NASA, what would you think of him?

Yes, my dear friend, that's you when you're looking for an ideal, bugles, google/apple approved library to put into your project while your client waits and nervously bites his nails. And same goes the other way around, if you're a client that hired a professional and then asks him to use some rarely used library that has the "enterprise" label on it, you also do the stupid thing.

I know, i know, getting from an artist to a plumber is quite a downshift, but you know what they say: "if you wanna be an artist, you gotta be a plumber too", and that's exactly what's going on in the software development. If you want to be an artist, that's cool, go to github and have fun, but if you have a real project, be a professional. Don't sit around waiting for an inspiration, just get the things done with what you've got and move on.
