# Get your dick out of your code

One smart man once told me a simple trick to being awesome

> Get your ego out of the things you do

The idea is simple, just remove the self-created preconceptions about the world from your way. Years pasted and it's still one of the best advises i had in life.

You see, there is a problem in software development sphere, we lack white hat role models. The thing is that to run a successful, hight profile project you have to be a dick, it's just what it is, a prerequisite for being able to filter massive feedback. And it's fine, people spend their lives on those projects after all. But the problem is that many others are trying to be like DHH or play Steve Jobs, and sadly, they not starting by building awesome products, they start with monkeying their behaviour, aka. being dicks.

Let me spell it you. There is only one way to learn things, it's called `get in troubles and grow`, that's how it works. And whoever does it faster wins the race. And the hard truth is that no matter how good you are, there are people out there that are better than you, and you have a choice, be a dick and ignore or learn from what they have to say.

And that's all really what's there to it.
