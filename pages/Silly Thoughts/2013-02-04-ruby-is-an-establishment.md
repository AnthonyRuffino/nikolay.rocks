# Ruby Is an Establishment

If you're young ambitious web-developer and you want to do it for long time, you should contribute to #nodejs, not to #ruby or #rails.

When you do it long enough, you can start to see the pattern, it was all the same for `C -> C++`, for `C++ -> Java`,  `Java -> Ruby` and it's all the same for `Ruby -> JavaScript`. The list of arguments is virtually the same, the only thing that changes is the name of the languages.

The old language becomes an establishment, it gets full of people who are there to protect their status, not to promote technologies. You can contribute there but you will be just wiping asses, that's all, coz they don't call it "establishment" for nothing. Everything was already established in there and people on top of it won't let you change anything.

Every time I return from a JavaScript project to a Rails one, I feel that the language is perfect, but the environment is a huge drag, complete ignorance of innovation or anything outside of ruby/rails scope. Wanna see a developer who's afraid of #javascript? Throw a stone in a crowd of rails developers and you'll hit two or three.

Zed Shaw mentioned that it will come it in his famous rant on rails, you might think that he'd blown it out of the proportions, that maybe, but the idea is kinda still correct. The ruby community is driven by a bunch of tired people and it's stagnating.

So what about #nodejs? It sucks right? But, have you seen Rails 1.0.0? It was blowing ass big time. But they will fix it and make it mind bogglingly awesome. The simple truth is that #javascript, due its simplicity  is much more flexible, abusable and fun than #ruby. It lacks certain things, and might do stuff that you wouldn't expect. But what do you want? #nodejs is a frontier and it's part of the fun.

And if you can't see the beauty in it, you probably shouldn't write code at all, coz you're a robot.
