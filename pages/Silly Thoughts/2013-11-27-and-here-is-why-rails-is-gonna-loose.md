# And Here Is Why Rails Is Gonna Loose

TL;DR #Nodejs has more humans and iterates faster.

It's probably a stupid thing to say, but I've been around the block for a while and I saw how #java went down and was replaced by #rails.

The problem with Java was that it's like a Boing 777, it's the whole universe and needs 100 people + an airport to operate. A solid enterprise and kinda makes sense if need to travel between continents, but a huge drag if you need to do small and medium size business.

And then this danish kid appeared with Rails. And it's a smooth ride to be honest, and we built this whole map of railroads which can get you pretty much anywhere. It might not be as fast as a jet, but tickets are cheap, you've got low overhead and things go quite predictable. And the best thing, you need just a few greasy programmers to operate it.

The problem with Rails is that well, it's rails, you can't turn the freaking thing. You only can switch on between the stations and the thing is quite massive, it takes time to start and stop it.

Node. Well, node has the V8 under the hood, and if we continue with our transportation analogy, it's like a racing car.
Yeah, it doesn't have an air conditioner or radio, but it didn't meant to! It's a racing car, it's built for speed. Node doesn't have much luxury, the ride is bumpy at times and you can crash it pretty badly if you don't know what you're doing.

But on the bright side, you don't need a railroad to drive it. You can turn wherever you want, you can go from 0 to 100 in seconds and you can even take it off road and take shortcuts if you feel particularly evil.

Analogies aside, if you take a look at the number of participants and the releases history, you can see that node has more humans working on it, and it iterates a lot faster. If on rails you get a new version every ~4 years, node releases every few months.

Now divide the number of humans by the length of a release cycle and you get the development speed. There is nothing personal about it, it's just science, the faster thing will always overtake the slower one.

So here it is. You can take the train, have the good old time in the restaurant carriage, maybe shoot some buffalos on your way, but in the end the racing car is faster and will beat the train despite of the head start.
