# Programming Happiness My A55

If you are a worthy programmer, then somewhere down in your soul, you probably have this nagging feeling that programming is an art, and you're this sort of a hidden artist in the rough who just happened to work in a bank and not really allowed to be artsy in your day job.

Well, let me crush it on you. Programming is not an art, it's not even an art-form. Programming is a medium, an instrument. Much like a paint, a guitar or a photo-camera. And art is what you're making out it.

And if you decompose those fuzzy feelings into three parts, the art, the medium and the person, everything falls in place. See, you can take the most beautiful programming language and use the most intricate software design patterns, but if you're building a banking application with it, you're not being an artist. You are being a 100% refined, totally organic, well paid corporate employee. It's just happened that instead of a suit and a cell phone, you have a t-shirt and a macbook air.

See, art is not about happiness, it's not about syntax correctness and beautiful design patterns. Art is about feelings and self expression. Art is spontaneous, and innocent, and useless in everyday life. Art is a cry and a hope to be understood.

And if you don't have this fire in your heart, it's okay, we still love you.  Just don't tell us which programming language will make us happier, coz it's as much stupid and pointless as telling a painter which color will add more happiness to his paintings.
