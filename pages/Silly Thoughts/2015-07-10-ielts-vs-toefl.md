# IELTS vs. TOEFL, Things You Need To Know

As I [mentioned before](/2015-06-28-ielts-accepting-the-defeat), in
the last few months I took the [IELTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_English_Language_Testing_System)
test several times in order to score 8 (out of 9) in every section
of the test. Then, for a comparison, I took the American
[TOEFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language)
exam, where I scored 109 (out of 120). And now I just want to write a
bit to compare those two and maybe give some suggestions which one you might want to take.

Generally speaking, both IELTS and TOEFL are English language exams
and measure relatively the same thing. You can even find some
spreadsheets on the Internet that compare scores in both tests
and show how they correlate to each other.

In reality they are actually two rather different things. IELTS is
a British old school exam, which is done with a paper and a pencil. And
TOEFL is an American test, which you take in front of a PC (yeah, I touched
windows, ewww). Furthermore, IELTS is usually taken as a _general_
grade test and TOEFL is more an _academic_ thing that you might need
to go to a uni.

But, lets do a piece by piece comparison to get a sense of it.

## The Reading Section

Generally, reading in TOEFL is a bit more challenging than IELTS.
If in IELTS you would normally read some ads and articles from the
times when paper news were cool, then in TOEFL you will see more
academic scrolls. You don't need to have any specific prior knowledge
in both cases to understand those texts. But, TOEFL texts have more
academic grade words and phrases in them, when IELTS is pretty much
what one could see in a news paper article or a casual blog post.

Where those two really differ is how they test the level of your
understanding of the materials. IELTS is really easy, you just need
to skim the text and find some matching words and then write them
down on a piece of paper. If you read regularly, it is hard to
screw it up. The only challenging part is when they ask `true/false/not given`
options. They often present it that there can be two right answers,
but they will accept only one of them as the actually correct one.
You don't always get to be right in IELTS, even if you know what
you're doing.

In TOEFL, on the other hand, questions are much harder and they
really test your detailed understanding of the text. More of that
they have sections of questions when they ask you to pick a closest
in meaning word from a list. The differences between the options
can be blurry at times. So you really need to know the precise
meaning of words to answer everything right.

## Listening Section

Generally speaking, IELTS listening section is easier. You just
listen to some conversations and write down the answers in a paper
as you hear them. But, the problem is that they always try to
trick you with some weird accents or a poor sound quality. Some
times a person can unexpectedly fire up a mobile phone number
or a 10-digits bank account, and you supposed to write it down.
I think that is a very specific skill that doesn't have much to
do with your understanding of spoken English.

In TOEFL, you listen to a set of lectures and conversations,
and then you answer some questions about them _afterwards_. This
requires you to have some good note taking skills (a pencil and
some paper are provided). But, I think it is a much more fair
and consistent way to test your ability to fully understand
audio materials.

Not to mention that in TOEFL you listen to those pieces
through headphones, not via some crappy speakers on the other
end of a class room.

## Speaking Test

The speaking sections are actually completely different in IELTS
and TOEFL. In IELTS it is done in a form of a casual interview.
You just chat to a real person on every-day topics. Then you
are given 2 minutes to speak on some specific subject. Then you
answer some related questions about the subject. And that's it;
overall ~10minutes.

In TOEFL you speak into a mic. They make you read some pieces of
text or listen to a conversation and then ask you to summarize
the details of those pieces in a short ~45 seconds burst. You have
several sections like that, but generally the principle is the same.

I find that both tests have their ups and downs here. In IELTS
you are get measured in real time, which makes it highly subjective.
Maybe the examiner didn't have a stellar day, maybe they didn't
like your haircut, or maybe they got beaten up by Russian immigrant
kids when they were in a high school. You will never know, all you
have at the end is a "thank you" and a poker face.

In TOEFL on the other hand you don't have a space to kidna build
the case and present your thoughts in a logical and concise manner.
Because the window is so small, you need to fire up right away
and hope that you will be on time to finish up your thought. But
then there is no human factor, you are measured anonymously and
all you have to do is to speak clearly and make sense.

## Writing Section

That is where IELTS fails completely in my mind. In IELTS you need
to write (on actual paper) a _formal_ letter and a _formal_ essay.
The first one is ~150 words long and the second one is ~250.

There are several problems with that. Firstly, in 21st century
we don't kill trees to communicate anymore. The last time I wrote
something on a piece of paper before the test was probably ~15 years
ago. It is a horrendously annoying thing to do now. Secondly, no one
writes formal letters anymore. The expected format of the text is
utterly obsolete. No one writes letters, sprinkles them with some
perfume and sends it with a post man anymore.

The only thing it tests really is your ability to pick up some dead
imperial traditions of the past. But, the real trick here is that,
the examiner is allowed to judge you and cut your score if they
feel like you memorized some of the phrases. Start to use large
fancy words and exemplary sentence structures and they will cut
you down. It is really hard to nail it down to they way an
examiner will like it. And, unfortunately, it has very little to
do with your real life ability to express yourself in a written format.

TOEFL is quite a bit more civilized in this regard. Firstly, you
use this awesome human invention, we call it "a keyboard". Secondly,
you write it on a computer screen, so you can edit and fine polish
the text without messing it up. Thirdly, you are actually granted
extra points if you write more text! (in IELTS no one cares)

You will still have to follow a proper text structure in TOEFL
though. But that is a good, proper skill anyways.


## Overall

Overall, I personally liked TOEFL much more. Where IELTS mostly
tries to tick you in some weird circumstances and just penalizes
you for that, TOEFL actually tests your ability to process information
and express yourself in English.

IELTS is generally easier but it just scrupulously watches an every
tiny detail. TOEFL hits you with more complex information, but it tests
your actual English language skills, like: note taking and detailed
knowledge of some more academic words.

So, which one should you take? Well, as I see it, there is a trick
to it. If you are allowed to take either of them, then you should
look at which score you need to produce.

If your target score is ~6-7 in IELTS terms, then go with IELTS.
It is actually an easier test and you will have plenty of headroom
for mistakes in the test.

But, if your goal is a high score, like 8 and above, then definitely
go with TOEFL. Unlike IELTS, TOEFL allows a certain degree of irregular
mistakes and, instead of being obnoxious about tiny irrelevant details,
it measures your real life English language skills and then grades
your high band performance more fairly.

Besides, when it comes to the high scores, in my experience, IELTS showed
very little correlation between the effort and the end result. So, I'd
definitely go with TOEFL if I needed to score a high band.
