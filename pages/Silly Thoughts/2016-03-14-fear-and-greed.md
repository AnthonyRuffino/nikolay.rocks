# The Fear and Greed in Software Development

Just a fair warning. Some of this things might make you uncomfortable. Just take
a deep breath, count to 10 and remember that this is not about you.

## Assets and Liabilities

I like simple theories. Yeah, they do miss important details. Simple theories
are not about important details though. They are important approximations of a
mess we call life. They give you a way to reason about things you otherwise
couldn't.

In economics, there is thing called a balance sheet. A balance sheet is basically
a two columns structure; one of them holds what is called "assets" and other is
called "liabilities". It is a very simple thing, I'm sure you have seen some of
those sheets before.

The interesting thing is though, the definitions of assets and liabilities are not
that clear. Ask, for example, an average middle class person and they will tell
you that a car they bought on a credit is an asset. A home loan is an asset too.
Jewelry. White goods, and so on.

And it kind of makes sense. When you get the next credit from a bank they will
let you list those as assets. But, then as far as your overall financial situation
goes, those are liabilities. The moment you drive that car off a lot, it looses
25% of its price. The moment you buy that ring, it looses 50%. The moment you
pay off your home loan, you pay on average a triple of its price. As far as
finances go, those things make you loose money.

And here is the beauty of the concept. They way economics look at assets and
liabilities is rather simple. What generates profit is an asset, what makes you
put money in someone else's pockets is a liability.

Have them or have not is a deeply personal and emotionally charged thing.

## Fear & Greed

Did I tell you how much I like simple theories? There is one that says that,
although we are evolved sentient beings, most of our behavior is controlled
by just fear and greed. Yeah, I wouldn't believe that either. But then again,
wouldn't that be a fear of my whole existence to be reduced to just two basic
emotions?

I love humans. I think humans are beautiful in a way. I always wondered why
people are in such a rush to their jobs in the mornings? Why the sense of belonging
to a certain profession is so alluring? But, mostly, why people hate javascript?

When I see people rushing to offices in cramped busses, I see mammals searching
for food. When I see software developers endlessly arguing about technology and
trying to stay ahead of the technological curve, I see hunter-gatherers chasing
wild animals and trying to shoot arrows ahead of their path.

The fear of loosing a paycheck is so strong within us. And the burning desire of
making it 5% larger is so alluring. It always makes you want it all and push
the boundaries where you can as far as you can.

That is why our industry is so full of opinionated dick-heads. That is why you
hate javascript. Not because it is threat to human intelligence, but because
it is a threat to you having it all. It is your greed and your fear that drive
you day to day and absorb all your thoughts year in year out.

## The Simple Things

Did I tell you how much I enjoy simple theories? Mainly because they let you
reason about ambiguous and complex things. Like for example I'm driven by fear
and greed, and lust, and wrath, and envy. But mostly by fear and greed. But what
can I do?

Well there is a simple theory in economics that is called assets and liabilities.
Why not apply it to your technology luggage?

Lets say here is a list of all tech that you know and want to know, and maybe,
could know. Instead of being lost in fear of loosing the edge and that fat paycheck
with it and be greedy trying to learn new things to impress your next employer,
how about separating them in two columns named assets and liabilities?

Lets call "assets" those things that get things done and bring paychecks. Even
though you might not particularly like certain bits and pieces of it. And lets
call "liabilities" those things that just eat your precious time. Even though
you might really really like them.

For example here is a list of my assets:

* `Ruby` - it is okay. Not the most exciting tech, but it gets things done where it fits
* `JavaScript` - it is a terrible language any way you look at it. i'm not going
to even pretend arguing this. But, it pays the bills quite well, it allows me
to work with the cutting edge tech in my field and it's 100% survivable in 99% of cases
* `Go` - i double hate its syntax. firstly for the `:=` and secondly for titleized
method names. But then it is a really good tool, it is quite well adopted and
I really should learn it better

And a list of liabilities:

* `Python` - i kind of like it, but I'm not going to land a job in it
* `Rust` - i really like the concept of it, but any time i try to actually build
something with it, I just waste time. I can get the same things done in Swift at
a quoter of the effort
* `Elm` - i really, really like the idea. If i'd be designing a language
it would be a lot like Elm. But it is completely impractical at this point. And
it is not going to pay the bills in the near future.

Now, while you're being pissed at my lists, lets make something clear here. Firstly,
this is my personal list, someone else's list will be different. Secondly, I'm
not discouraging anyone from learning new things. I'm encouraging you to be
practical about it.

## Bottom Line

I'm sorry for this awfully long post, and believe me I'm thankful if you've read
this far. The idea I want to leave you with is that living in denial of your
emotions towards things you care about is, well, dumb. Suppressing them or
ignoring them will not get you anywhere. They will keep ruling your decisions.

The way out of this cycle is simple theories. Pick one and try to think
_quantitively_ about your choices. And try to pick those things that actually
bring something to your life, rather just suck the living jesus out of you.
That's all.
