# A Year With JavaScript

So, here is the thing. Roughly a year ago I broke up with #Ruby.

Nah, don't feel sorry, we had it long coming. It had been a really great and
fruitful relationship though; almost 10 years. I wrote tonnes of code, I went to
places, I met awesome people. I hardly can complain.

But, ultimately, we wanted different things in life. She wanted me to be an
opinionated white male rockstar on the Internetz, and I; well, I just wanted to
write poetry. If that makes sense.

So, at some point we just decided that it will be best for both of us if we
break up. And so, we split our friends; and package managers; and wished each
other a good life.

Fucking adults, man! Can't even slam the door when it counts.

Anyhow. Later, I caught up with an old friend #JavaScript. She, like me was in a
bit of a mess. She just left a long stale relationship with ES4 and were on her
rebound with ES5.

And so we talked. You know, the usual, how is it going? What's been happening
with you in the last years? One thing led to another, and before you know it
we were building our first artificial intelligence together.

Yeah. Well... Anyhow.

I can't really say that it was a smooth sailing from the start though. There were
a few confusing things at the beginning. You know, the usual: do we babel or do
we use harmony flags? Is it async/await or ES6 generators? What our eslint config
would look like? And who of our parents do we listen to Flow or TypeScript?

But, the important thing is that we are working through our problems together.
Not everyone gets all what they want all the times; and frankly some days
just make me #bash my head against the wall. But, in the end of the day, we
always were able to come to our senses and find a common ground.

And friends. I must say that friends were great in this last year! Very supportive
and yet considerate. I really appreciate your help in this year folks. I really
do. I hope I'll be able to pay you back for your kindness some day.

Overall, the last year, it's been really transformative to my soul. There is not
much of judgement or high expectations in my life anymore. She accepts me for who
I am, and, in return, I do the same.

We don't go to any the fancy conferences anymore, neither do we enjoy any fine
art architectures in our modules. But, in exchange, we're free to try any new
wacky things we think would be fun to build. And this worth everything to me.

It's like poetry, you know. It's not about right or wrong, it's about love and
life. And it all doesn't have to make any god damn sense to anyone.

And that makes me happy.
