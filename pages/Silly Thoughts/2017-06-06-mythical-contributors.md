# The Myth of an Open-Source Hero

This article is a reflection on the interaction i had with some people on the
Internet about the open-source culture. I'm amending the real names, because
a) i don't want to personalize the problem and b) because it's not about specific
people, it's a more systemic problem that we have in our industry. And i would
like to talk about it.

> me: the next version of package xxx-xxx is a disaster. I'd be embarrassed to
> release something like this to my users.

> some one on the internet: I'd be embarrassed to complain about something given
> to me for free, created by people in their free time

If I'd had a dollar for every time someone repeats this story to me, I'd have
a whole 5 dollars by now. Which, considering that I'm virtually nobody in the
pecking order, is actually an awfully lot.

Funnily enough the author of the package `xxx-xxx` jumped into the conversation
and basically yelled at me for expressing my dissatisfaction with his software.
Which was a little embarrassing to watch at that point.

But, lets look at this story closer. Because it repeats itself over and over
again. And an awful lot of people get sidetracked by its face value idea: something
was build for free and given me for free, so I should shut up and say nothing.

## Is it built for free?

In our industry we tend to have this idilic image of an open-source author
who's basically a lone hero. Who sits there after work and creates packages
out of their sheer good will.

This makes sense. No one directly pays them for building those projects in their
spare time. But, then this begs a question, if there is no profit in it, why
an impressive number of people do it?

One could argue that because those individuals are good people. Okay, so if this
is just a nature of humans to be good people. Why don't we see say truck drivers
offering free deliveries after they've done with their shift? Or surgeons doling
out free surgeries outside of their practices? Policemen enforcing the law extra
2-3 hours every day after they finish their shifts?

The truth is blunt. Because open-source pays. Every popular package author i
know is eventually paid in status or in a boosted salary; usually both. I know
this because i did exactly the same thing. It actually pays so well that people
abuse it left and right. Why do you think it attracts so many a-hole-ish
educated white male types? Precisely because it pays handsomely and there is no
one to stop you from abusing it.

We should stop the pretense that open-source projects authors are heroes who
save virgins from dragons for free. It's a lot of BS. All of them eventually are
paid for their work. And how much the bonus is is gauged by how popular their
work is. Which means they owe it to their users who gave them GitHub stars and
trusted their work.

## Free as in puppy

Another argument that I hear frequently is _"it was given to you for free"_.

At the face value yes, technically I did not pay for using it. My employer did
though. They paid for me adopting your technology. And when you mess up with
the next major update, they pay me and my team to figure workarounds and fix
the mess.

Again, no one really pays the authors money directly. But, every day, countless
number of companies pay their engineers to learn, adopt and support the open-source
software.

Lets look at the package `xxx-xxx` for example. The one I started the rant with.
I know that thousands upon thousands of projects use it. It has an impressive
400k downloads per month number. Even if you consider CI tools and such, this means
that there is close to 100k projects that use it.

Now, if a half of those projects decide to spend 1-2-3 human days to go through
the pain of upgrading to the next major version, how much do you think this costs
the industry collectively?

```
50'000 projects
1-2 human day/per project
$50/hour average senior engineer salary
----
$20'000'000 - $40'000'000
```

We're talking about a mind blowing `$20-40M` in industry wide damages. Let me
repeat this for you. This mess costed us collectively tenths of millions of dollars
to sort it out.

And that's just a small, barely important package in the grand scale of things.
There are a way bigger fishes in the ocean.

If you call this free. I don't know what you call "paid".

## You should be thankful

To be honest, I'm struggling right not to address this in a nice civilized manner.
I had a friend once who used to say: _"sometimes the right answer to a question
is fuck you"_.

But, let me try. Should all people be thankful to Jesus and roll over for the
church? Should black people be thankful for being allowed to vote and be cool
with casual racism for that? Ok, let me try something less abrasive. Should
junior developers be thankful for the senior engineers wizdoms and lough along
when they dole out sexists remarks?

I'm not going to hide this. The shortmindness of this type of comments makes me
angry. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful that there is a ready to use solution
for my problems. But, this does not give anyone the right to abuse people and
tell them to shut up with their opinions. This is simply undignifying.

If your software is shit, and my trust in it returns with pain. I have all the
rights to tell you about it. I'm not telling you that you shouldn't be frustrated
by it. You have built it, i've been there, i get it. But, telling people to shut
up because it was "free", that's something completely different. That's called
being an insufferable a-hole.

## The conclusion

Well, there is not much of a conclusion. Neither i offer a solution to the problem.
I guess I'm just frustrated how often the "shut up it was given you for free"
phrase is being told and re-told over and over again.

I just hope this will help some of you to look at the problem from a different
angle.

And make the world a slightly better place, obviously.
