# Here We Go

I'm starting a new section here to write about my attempts to learn surfing.
I'm kind of setting up a trap for myself. I know if I try something new and
never write about it, I'll just either quietly quit, or just hate myself for
not writing about it when I was in the process. Writing things down helps
me to stay on course.

I'm not exactly sure why I'm doing this. I think in a way it is self-fucking-prooving
myself all over again. Or I just watched "Point break" too many times.

I was born in the Altai region of Siberia, near the Russian/Mongolian border.
If you think of it, this is the most distant place on this planet from any kind
of waves. I was 30 years old when I saw the ocean for the first time. Saying
I was impressed is like saying nothing. I was blown away. Still am in a way.

Now I'm 37, and I really want to tell myself that I'm too old for this shit.
But, I don't want to tell myself things. Even if that is the case, I want to
give it a fair fight. And now is the best time for it.

The ambiguity of the project, the long learning curve, it scares me a bit. I know
for many who grew up in here, it's nothing. It is probably like riding a bike.
But it is strange and wicked to me. Yet, I want to be there. So, I'm kind of
going into a short-minded view. One step at a time.

We'll see where it will get me.
