# Too Fast And Shallow

Today is the second day. I had way too much fun the last time and was a bit
nervous about doing it again. But, it is funny the way the ocean affects me.
The moment I step into that cold water and being smacked in the guts by a
wave, I just forget everything. My brain really goes blank.

I know next to nothing about waves. I took a lesson with an instructor couple of
years ago, and I approximately know where I supposed to go as a total noob. But,
I just don't have enough experience to judge about those things yet.

Today waves weren't that tall at all. But they were rather fast. Plus a bit of
a wind and a current. I had to paddle like really hard to keep up and get anywhere.
I caught a few of them, but mostly they just passed by.

I'm a relatively fit guy; I lift and I run. But, catching up a wave requires a
different type of fitness. I'm just too slow. Yet. I'm wondering if should get
a shorter board or a longer one to pick up speed quicker? I tried a longer one
today and it felt so much heavier and harder to push. I run out of breath in ~30
minutes. heh...

While I was helplessly fighting waves and a current in there. I watched this
60+ years old guy effortlessly paddling through the breaks and surfing circles
around me. Darn, that dude was awe inducing!
