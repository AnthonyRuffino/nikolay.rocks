# Surfing: Trying a Minimal

There is a certain level of blessing in trying to learn something you have
pretty much no idea about. It is easier to go and ask questions and understand
what people are trying to say to you.

After being smacked by waves the last time, I went to talk to a friend of mine
who knows about surfing ~20 years more than me. Well, apparently there are
waves and there are waves. The short and quick swell that hit me the last time
is apparently the type that is getting created by the local winds.

Unlike proper swell that comes from the ocean, the local swell apparently
doesn't carry that much energy with the wave itself. So, unless you actually
ride it, it will pretty much pass you by. Well, I failed and then I learned
things. My favorite type of learning!

Today's morning was pretty quiet. Almost no wind, and waves were the proper type.
A bit small, but perfect for an idiot like me. To make things more interesting,
today I rented a slightly shorter minimal (7'4"), just to see how it will go
and feel the difference.

Turned out it is different. It is definitely less stable, but then it is much
more nimble. Riding a 8+ heavy softy is like trying to ride a log. It is stable
but it is really hard to control. A shorter, lighter board actually clearly
responds to what you're trying to do. In a sense, I think it needs more attention,
and it is probably more challenging, but I like it more. It gives me an immediate
feedback on my fails and I understand what I'm doing wrong better.

I got so excited, that caught a nose down (i totally need to learn the lingo).
I tripped over it, face down, got a full mouth of salty water. That was fun.

Anyways. I'm having fun, and that is a good thing. Suddenly realized today that
it's `12 of Feb`. I'm loosing the sight of time. Somehow, I feel more human
this way.
