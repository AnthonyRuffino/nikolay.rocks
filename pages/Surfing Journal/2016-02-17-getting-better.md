# Surfing: Getting Better

A good session today. For the last couple of weeks we went through the low point
and now the morning swells are finally starting to pick up. It was a bit windy
today, so the norther part of Manly was a mess, but the southern one is sheltered
from the winds so it was quite good actually.

I got the same 7'10" mini mal today, and I feel like I'm slowly getting a hang
of it. I can stand on it pretty much every time, but there is not enough speed
and energy in the foam to actually enjoy it. I think it is time for me to step
up the game.

Now I need to figure how to catch an actual wave sideways. This is exciting
though. Progressing in something new is always invigorating! I'm wondering if
there are good online courses for surfing where they can explain things. I'd
pay for that.

On the other news, they're building a stage in the middle of Manly for the
Australia Open championship. That might be interesting. Although I'm wondering
why they chose Manly. I love the town, but that is not exactly the best surfing
spot on the shore. Well, they know better.
