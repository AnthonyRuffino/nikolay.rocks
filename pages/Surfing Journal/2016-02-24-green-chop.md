# Surfing: Going For The Green

After a good session the last time, I felt cocky. I decided it is time to go
for the green waves. Unfortunately, the ocean had different plans today. He was
actually kind of a dick today: a high tide, all choppy, lots of current. I got
smashed into a drain water pipe on Manly. Got my fingers shredded quite a bit.

It's funny how much scratches sting in a salty water. Oh, well. So, I was trying
today to get over the break, to where waves start. Turned out it is a lot of work.
Funny, how the whole process reminds me of riding a toboggan down a snowy hill.
Either way, I ended up mostly practicing roll overs and catching whatever came
my way. All this chop of a local swell is a bit over my head right now. But,
that's what makes it so exciting!

Either way. Made some friends with a surfboard shop owners. They are good people,
a bit direct, but they mean well. And, I was thinking a lot lately about the
whole thing. What makes me come back there over and over. Because I know it is
not just a challenge and the process of learning new things.

I start to think that it is the feeling that you've been left fucking alone. It's
weird. I don't mean it in a wrong way, there are people who love me and wish me
well, and I'm not trying to say that I don't care and want to run away. It is
different. It is this place where there are no expectations. All everything is
left on the shore, and it is just you, and the waves. It is not even about
being yourself, it is about loosing yourself completely. It is weird. And good.

Also, I kind of hate myself now for not starting earlier. I lived here for over
three years now. I think I do this a lot in life, overthinking stuff and finding
reasons why I shouldn't do this and that. It is so stupid.
