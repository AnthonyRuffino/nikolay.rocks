# Surfing: Over The Break

Today I managed to get over the break. Which is awesome! I tried to get there the
last time and got just smacked around. After that I went home and watched a whole
bunch of videos on YouTube. It's almost scary how much stuff you can learn from
YouTube those days. And it pays off!

It's interesting actually. When I just started, the ocean looked like: "hooray
waves! let's do this". It's just a random mess of things. But, it is wicked how
good human brains are at recognizing patterns! Now there is a whole world of things!
The break, shoulders, rip curl, swell, sections. And it's all moving and lives
by its own rules.

Somehow it reminds me of learning Japanese. When you start, it's just a sea of
randomness. All those lines and characters, there is no system. It is a total
and complete chaos. But, over time you learn things bits by bits, and you start
to recognize patterns. Those characters used for that, those for this. You start
to understand groups of symbols and so it goes. Same thing with surfing.

It's weird. I never actually saw the ocean from the other side of the break. I
always kind of perceived it from the shore point of view. It was this volatile
mess of waves smashing onto the beach. Over the break it's much more gentle and
relaxing. You can see from there how the waves and breaks actually form. Up close
and personal.

Well, now I understand what I actually supposed to do. Now I just need to learn
how to do it. I didn't manage to go along a shoulder today, but I did jumped onto
several green ones. I even had my first cut-in today! So it is official!

Also, do you know that moment when you watch surfers from the shore and sometimes
people are being smacked by a wave sideways when they try catch it? Yeah, I've
been that dude today several times. Haha. It's funny how quickly it teaches you
not to yell "oh, shit!" when that happens! Well, as I said, it's a learning
experience.

And an afterthought. I was just thinking that is such a human nature to find
scary and potentially volatile things and make them fun. The surf sometimes
might look pretty scary from the beach side. But it so much fun to ride. Somehow
I almost feel like I'm a kid blowing stuff up in the woods while no one watches.
Or, maybe it's just me.

Also, I'm a bit sad. The summer is over, and my unemployed break is over. I have
to do 9 to 5s now and I have no idea how to squeeze surfing into this routine.
I'm sure I'll figure something, but it won't as wild and free as before. Oh well.
That's life.
