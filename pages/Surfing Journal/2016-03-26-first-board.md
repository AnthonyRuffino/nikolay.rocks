# Surfing: The First Board

So, I guess this is official now. I have bought my first real board. I've spent
~two months on mini-mals. I decided not to buy a minimal when I just started.
Mainly because I don't have a space or a large enough cart to fit a ~8ft chunk.
But I also knew it was a temporary phase and I would have to sell it soon. So, I
rented instead.

After a bit of contemplation, talking to friends and waiting for the right thing
to pop in the market, I bought a 6'8" fish board. Normally, for my size something
like a 6'2" or 6'4" would be a good choice. But, because I'm still a beginner,
I needed something around ~7' with a wide enough base to give it a bit more
flotation. Hence I ended up with a pretty broad 6'8" fish.

I thought for a bit between a shortboard and a fish. And I figured that, considering
I'm a beginner, a large fish will have a less steep learning curve. Especially
as it is considered to be a good choice for small waves; and, that's where I
find myself most of the time anyways.

So, today I took it for a ride, and it was fun. I'm glad that I didn't rush it
and spent enough time on mini-mals, otherwise I don't think I would know what to
do with this short thingy. It really does feel quite feedly when you switch from
a longer board to a shorter one, and if I didn't have previous experience I think
I would be lost in it's nimbleness.

I'm really happy I moved on though. I don't know, maybe it just me, but it really
feels that it is so much easier to catch waves than it was with a minimal. It is
less steady, that is true, but it picks up speed very quickly, and that is what
I've been missing when trying to learn how to jump on the green ones. This time
I managed to stay with a wave almost every time. Couldn't do much after that,
but well, it's a process right?

Another thing is that now I need to figure how to duck-dive. I tried to hack it,
but apparently it is not that straight forward. Well at least to me. It's one
of those things that were really bugging me on a mini-mal. I had to turtle roll
it. And it's a lot of hassle. Especially if you run into a section. By the time
you get to the break you're all tired and arms are like noodles. Now, with a
shorter board I can dive under the waves. I just need to figure how to do it! :)

Either way. I'm really happy to get my own board. I don't depend on rental offices
anymore. Now, I hope, I will be able to drive to the shore early in the morning,
so I could be back for my work by ~9 am. And it is also a new thing that opens
new doors; which is awesome!
