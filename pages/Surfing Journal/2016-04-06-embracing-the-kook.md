# Surfing: Embracing The Kook

In surfing, kook is a term for a beginner. It is not a neutral term though and
usually comes with "fucking" in front of it. Surfing can be exhilarating and a
dangerous at the same time. An explosive mix. Add some idiot that gets in your
way and you get a kook.

It's been roughly 2 months since my first record. I feel like I've graduated
from a complete idiot to a kook. It finally started to sink with me just how
complex the surfing process really is, and how much effort it takes to learn.

I'm a rather sporty guy and well coordinated. I think. I have previous experience
with skateboards and snowboards and skies and ice skating and a whole bunch of
other things. Yet, even two months later, surfing keeps challenging me in ways
no other sport did.

The sheer complexity of surfing and yet it's potential for learning is really
something. This weird mix of feelings like "everything is possible" and "what
the hell am i doing here". I can see now why so many people surf their brains out.
It makes total sense now. And I want to keep going.

So. Hi, I'm Nikolay and I'm a kook. And it makes me happy.
