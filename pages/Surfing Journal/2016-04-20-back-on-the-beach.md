# Surfing: Back In The Line Up

The summer is over and the seasonal cold and flue wave is in the town. So, I've
been lucky and caught some cold myself as well. Was sick the last week. Missed
it a lot. Now I'm back to the morning line up. And it feels good.

There is something really special to it. An option to wake up early in the morning,
drive to the beach before the dawn, catch a few waves, then get yourself a coffee
and a bacon-egg roll and just sit there on the shore and watch kids ripping it.
And all that before going to work. It really sets your day in the right mood.
I'm such a lucky fuck to have this privilege.

Sometimes I see older surfers in a cafe, guys in their 50s â€” i think. You can
see those beautiful creatures shaped by the sea; wiry and slender. They sit behind
a cafe table in groups, talking quietly, backs upright, like they're sitting in
a line up; just watching for the sets.

It makes me wondering, what it must be like? To grow up in a family near a shore.
Half of your friends surf. And you start at age 5 or something, and then you surf
every other day for the next 50 years. You can almost feel this calmness being
embroiled into a person by surfing. Awe inducing.

Sometimes I go in, and I do some basic exercises in white water. Like popping up
and duck diving. And sometimes I see 5-7 year old kids doing the same thing next
to me. It's a fun position to be in. Makes you wonder about things. I'm not even
jelly about it. I just think it's awesome that some kids have this option in life.
I hope some day my kids will have it too.

I feel like it starts to change me. When I was sick and just laying there in a
bed, I didn't really feel the usual misery. I'd just close my eyes and breathe,
and I would hear the air coming in and out, and it would sound like waves washing
on the shore. And it's just life, it's messy and that's okay. 4 days later you
will be running back into it.

There always will be the next wave. With me or without. And that's humbling.
That makes me feel alive and somehow happy.
