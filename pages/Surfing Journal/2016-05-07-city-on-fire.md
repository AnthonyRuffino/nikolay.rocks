# Surfing: The City Is On Fire

I woke up early today because the air smelled like bacon. I literally had a bacon
egg roll in my dream. Turned out bushes are on fire again and the whole city
was filled with smoke. Time to pack my stuff quickly and make a run for the beach.
Like there is no tomorrow.

I picked another, smaller break this time. It is pretty short and can be dumpy.
But, there is a nice spot where two shoulders meet and I can pick small leftovers
from both sides. And it was amazing. Really glossy, slow shoulders, you can actually
see there what you're doing and what others do. I actually managed to catch a few
small 1-2 foot ones and ride them towards the beach.

Turned out I was an idiot for the past month. I was going to another break that
whole time, where more grown up public hangs out. But, that place is a bit messy,
there are two breaks that very close to each other and they meet at an angle.
It doesn't produce that much smaller waves, but has pretty consistent larger
ones. It was kinda stupid to try to learn things in there.

Oh, well. You learn, then you fail and then you actually learn things. All good.
I almost figured duck-diving in this smaller and simpler break. I feel like I'm
getting really close to actually riding a shoulder. Just a bit more practice.

On the other things. It's been three months. And it feels like an eternity. And
a good one. So, I've been thinking a lot lately. I suddenly started to remember
things from my previous lives. People and stuff I enjoyed to do. Strangely enough,
I feel like those last three months were the happiest days of my life in a really
really long time.

Somehow I don't feel like I'm throwing punches left and right just to survive.
I don't feel like I need to hurt myself to feel alive anymore. I just live. And,
every day I think what a lucky fuck I am to have this.

I remembered that before I became a software developer, I actually really liked
people. I enjoyed humans, their quirks and different characters. I had an itch
to write. You know, about life, and love, and struggles. And then somehow I just
started to repeat those things over and over again, without actually feeling them.

Software is a really prejudice profession I think. On one side you have a wast
difference in performance between individuals. On the other, there is big deal
of isolation from human condition. Such environment breeds inconsiderate a-holes
really quickly. I turn into a proper a-hole quite often as well. And I hate that
about myself.

But, once more I feel real empathy towards humans again. I feel a connection and
I don't have an urge to judge people anymore. Even when they're being insufferable
a-holes.

I just feel like an imperfect living being. And I enjoy this; a lot.
