# Surfing: Small Waves And Commitment

My wife went away for a view weeks to visit her parents. So, I decided to take
the opportunity and was surfing almost every day for the last week and a half.
At the same time we've been going through a low tide phase and waves were almost
non existing; barely waist high. On the other hand, it was a great opportunity
to work on my technique and small things. And I'm actually having a good progress.

I can do duck-diving pretty consistently now, which makes life on the waves so
much easier. And I've done the bottom turn multiple times and even was riding
a shoulder for a few seconds. Can't do that consistently yet or stay with the
pocket, but, I think I have figured what was my problem.

I've met a friend of mine a week ago. He has been surfing since he was 5 I think.
Either way, we talked and it turned out I was doing a wrong thing this whole
time. Who woulda thought?

The problem was that I was kind of shy about it. I'd paddle out and stay on an
edge of a break, a bit away from the line up and the center of the impact zone.
I'd try to pick up small leftovers and unridden shoulders. Unfortunately, those
bits, although would look okay-ish to me, didn't really have much energy in them
to launch me onto a proper trajectory. Even though I was working on my paddling
a lot, the fact that I was in the wrong place at the right time was nullifying
my efforts.

This opened a whole new dimension in surfing to me. It is not just about a
proper technique, fitness and timing, it is in many aspects about commitment.
And this is about a different sort of commitment that I knew before.

Say skateboarding requires a lot of commitment. You need to break your fear of
getting hurt to skate successfully. Or say in snowboarding, you need to commit to a
slope and battle your fear of the height and speed and inability to bail on a
spot, like in skating. Surfing though is about a whole different type of commitment.

Surfing can be pretty scary at times. You need to work with a serious amount of
energy that can throw you ten meters away and not feel anything. This can be
intimidating, but commitment in surfing is not about the fear. Commitment in
surfing, as I see it now, is about being in the right time at the very middle
of it and you need to commit to make everything right top to bottom in order
to harness that energy.

It is not the dumb type of commitment like in skating, where you commit to
battle your fear. Commitment in surfing is about respect and making things
right. One's fear is completely besides the point there.

The more I think about it, the more surfing culture starts to make sense to me.
Like, why surfers often so passionate about respecting the nature. Or why a
line up works in a specific way, and why there are certain rules.

It is still very hard to articulate this sense to me; it is more of a feeling
at this point. But, I start to feel an alignment there. I start to enjoy
looking into other surfers faces at a break and see understanding in their eyes.
And I just smile back.
