# Surfing: The Addiction

My wife was away for a few weeks, and so for the last two weeks I've been going
to the beach practically every morning. Sadly there wasn't much of a swell in the
last week or so, so it wasn't that exciting. But, I still managed to work on a
few things. The weird part is how I started to feel towards surfing because of
those frequent sessions.

I had my share of addictions in life. I've been a smoker for many years and it
took me a lot of effort to break the habit. At some point I had a pretty serious
drinking problem. It was so bad that I stopped drinking completely for over a
year. At some stages I also battled sugar and coffee addictions. So, I think I
know an addictions when I see one.

I've been waking up every day at 6am, pack my stuff, run to a car and have a
30 mins drive to the beach. Every day. So, a few days ago it was a shitty weather,
quite chilly and rather windy right at the dawn. I figured I'd take a break,
because I felt exhausted. Yet, after a short inner struggle, I packed my stuff
and drove to the beach anyways.

Because I had a bit of a late start I hit the morning traffic. And I went super
cranky on the way there. I was just angry with everyone, almost if someone took
my cigarettes away. Moreover, after I finally hit the water and caught couple of
small waves, I had a real kick from it. Like when you'd have a cigarette or a cup
of coffee after a long break.

And after a long day, I'd crash in my bed and close my eyes and all I saw were
waves. You know like when you play too much tetris on a TV, and then you go to
sleep, and you close your eyes, and you'd keep seeing figures falling down. Same
thing, only I'd see the waves getting ready to collapse over a break.

I'm not sure how to process this at this point. I feel hooked. I _want_ to go
there every morning. Even though it's almost winter and it's pretty chilly in
at dawn. Even though the water gets colder and it starts to really hurt when I
accidentally hit the board the wrong way. Even though I'm spending an hour in
traffic every morning because of that.

It is an addiction, I have no doubts about this. But then, I'm not really hurting
anyone. More of that I feel much more focused. And, just in two weeks my body
got into much better shape than it was in years. Even though I go to the gym
regularly. There is a good deal of anger and irritation though when something
stands between me and the fix.

On the other hand, this might be my suppressed anger getting out. I feel that
surfing was quite transformative to my psyche in the last few months. I've got
a pretty substantial luggage from the old dark days; neatly tucked away. Slowly
this luggage started to dissolve. The process brings a lot of emotions with it,
a lot of anger and frustration and pain. And I'm trying to let it all out. I
don't want to hold on it in anymore.

For a long time I used to play this game as part of personal therapy. Imagine
you're on a bus full of rather weird characters. Some of them are disgusting, some
are repulsive, some are angry. You pick one, take them off the bus and try to have
a honest conversation with them; listen to what they have to say. It is a way
to communicate with your inner daemons.

And my bus was one of those double sized express buses. It was literally packed;
I couldn't even walk in to pick someone to talk to. Now it is almost empty. I
keep coming back there now and then, but there is no one to talk to anymore. It
freaks me out a bit.

I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that I'm confused; a lot. On one
hand I have a very familiar feeling of an addiction from surfing. On the other
hand, I've never felt more like a human being than now, and I really want to keep
working in that direction. Moderation seems like an obvious answer. But then
again, moderation and mediocrity are two faces of the same coin.

We'll see what will happen next.
