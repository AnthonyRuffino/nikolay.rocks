# Surfing: Existential Crisis

One of the weird perks of surfing is that you don't have to be in the water to
enjoy waves. I can just grab a large cup of coffee, sit on the shore and stare
at the waves for an hour, easy. I'd just look at their shapes, how they break,
shoulders, pockets, count peaks in a set. And, the more I look at them the more
I realize that waves are an almost perfect manifestation of an existential crisis.

See, the waves don't really exist. Well, at least per our stupid monkey brain
measure of existence. The water exists. Molecules of h2o exist, the salt exist,
but waves don't. Waves are just weird flukes of energy.

Somewhere in Antarctica a severe cold storm smashes the water with all its fury.
And that anger and energy makes water molecules to stretch and squeeze. Eventually,
this commotion packs into some more visible energy distribution patterns that
we call waves. Those packs of energy then travel thousands of kilometers to the
shores of Australia where we can ride them. But, they don't exist as physical
matter, waves just manifest through it.

The more I think about it, the more I realize that I don't exist either. My body
does. It has like limbs and a torso and a head, and a whole bunch of cells and
molecules in it. But my body is not really me, it carries my physical manifestation,
just like water carries waves.

One could sit at a shore and look at waves all day long, and they will seem real.
A wave can very really smash you sideways and throw your body a few meters away.
But, it's not the water in a specific shape that you can see with your eyes that
will do it. It's the _energy_ that _is_ within the water that smacks you around.

You also can paddle out on a board over a break. And you can sit there perfectly
still and waves will just pass through you, like you don't exist. Your body is
80% water, so you're semi-transparent to a wave. But then you can turn around
and use your _will_ to align yourself with the energy of a wave and suddenly
everything becomes real. Your _thought_ aligns with the _energy_ of a wave and
then both of your physical manifestations can visibly move together in an enjoyable
ride.

Weird huh?...
