# Surfing: Difficult Times

Last few weeks were, well,.. difficult. I generally felt mentally stretched,
exhausted even. I'd go in the water and I'd flinch at waves every single time.
I felt like I was just dealing punches left and right; aimlessly. No wonder that
my surfing sessions were less than stellar.

Then, a several weeks ago, passed away my older brother. I had my first paddle
out ceremony. Just a sad and lonely, one guy thing. Although I'm glad I did it
anyways. Then there was an exhausting trip back to Russia; three days each way.
Grieving mother, a bit lost younger brother. A trip to a cemetery where half of
my male classmates already resting; some in peace, some not so much. My brother's
grave. Fuck it was hard.

I'm back now. Trying to recuperate; recover some of the peace of mind and muscle
strength. I went back into the water today and surfed until the wax on my board
was gone and my feet would just slip off. I needed this. I'm better now.

Just breath in and breath out. Imagine waves passing through you and listen to
the sound of the break as you're exhausting. It will get you through the day.
