# Surfing: Try Harder

Last month was well, busy. I was sick with a flu, then recovering, so no surfing.
It's been raining quite a lot, so no surfing. There was a lot of work at work,
so no surfing. And.. I spiraled back into a depression and started to see a shrink.

Yeah, I know, I'm a big idiot. But, hey, at least I'm trying harder. Anyways,
back to the surfing.

So, last few weeks, I was learning to move around reposition myself constantly
for a wave. I don't know, it just kind of made sense. I also was chasing the smaller
waves in a shallow water, like 2 footers and such. And I'm getting better at this.
I can see now waves approaching and get myself in the right spot to catch it. I
even almost figured the bottom turn.

The trick that revealed itself is that you need to constantly look at a wave,
how it takes a shape, then position yourselves correctly for it. And then you
need to try harder. My problem before was that, I was just trying to gain some
speed before the wave arrives and then did almost nothing when it would hit me.

Turned out I needed to do quite the opposite. I needed to slowly position myself
for waves. Save energy until it starts lifting the tail. And only then try harder
and push myself with all the energy forward. With this, I can consistently catch
small waves now.

3 footers an higher are still too much for me. I keep tilting and flipping over.
There is probably another thing to it that people keep telling me and I keep
not listening and surffering like a man.

Anyways, all this chasing of smaller waves made me look at the whole dance from
a bit different angle. I've noticed that a large bulk of surfers, come and sit
there waiting for a largest wave in a set. They don't move around, they're just
sitting there, waiting for the largest, most manly wave to come to them. And then
the wave comes, but they're either scared to take it, or positioned for it badly,
or don't have the skill to ride it. So, they miss it or wash out. But, they don't
see it, they just keep sitting there with grumpy faces, waiting for a large glorious
thing to come and redeem their failures.

I did that too, I did that a lot. And not just in surfing. But, hey, at least
I'm trying harder!
