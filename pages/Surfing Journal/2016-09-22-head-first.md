# Surfing: Going Head First

The thing I love about learning surfing is that it's quite often seemingly illogical.
Sometimes you need to do things that go against your expectations and gut feelings.

Couple of weeks ago I've met this dude on the internets who explained to me why
I was failing on larger waves. The short answer is because I was acting like
a moron and was holding myself back.

When a larger wave would come, I'd be like "oh, i'm not so sure, this thing
looks like a mountain, late me try to take it slow". Wrong answer motherfucker!
What I shoulda do instead is to stick to it, go head first and try to gain as
much velocity as possible. And I was doing the opposite, I was trying to take
it slow, like i'd be riding a snowboard off a steep cliff.

The key here is the speed. If you don't get enough of it in time, the nose of a
board won't lift properly and eventually will burry in and tumble you over. But,
if you go fast enough, it will raise, like a nose of a motor-boat; and then you
can lean on it as surf ahead of the wave as it was intended to be.

So, with this in mind, i was focusing on speed in the last few sessions. And it
works! Trying to go fearlessly head first and gaining as much speed as possible,
I managed to catch quite a few ~3-foot ish waves. Also, turned out when you
have enough velocity the bottom turn comes way more naturally than when you're
trying to do it in a closing out small wave. Duh, right?

We there is that. Lesson learned. If you're failing less than 9 times out of 10,
you're doing it wrong. Be bolder, fail more. There is no point in doing what
you know you already can do. It's not gonna get you anywhere.
