# Surfing: Hitting The Plateau

I haven't been writing here much lately. I was going back and fourth about it,
but I think I've hit a plateau in my surfing progress.

For the last couple of months the progress was rather mediocre. I've been out
there in the water practically twice a week; which is even more than before.
Yet my progress seems to get slowed down to almost a stale. At least it feels
this way.

I paddle out. I hunt for waves. I catch them. My weaves count is actually pretty
decent now. In fairly good conditions I can consistently take off from waves up
to head high. But, I can't seem to figure how to do things after that. I mean,
aside from the obvious riding it perpendicularly towards the shore.

And to make things worse, we've been having onshore mess in the waves for weeks
now. When it gets a bit rough, on small beaches, I can't even punch through the
break with my 6'8". It has quite a bit rocker and quickly becomes a problem in
a strong current.

So, I've been a fair bit frustrated with it lately. But, I keep coming back.
It still fills some hole in me regardless of how good the swell was.

I'm thinking about getting a slightly flatter and shorter board. Maybe that
will help with the turns and paddling.
