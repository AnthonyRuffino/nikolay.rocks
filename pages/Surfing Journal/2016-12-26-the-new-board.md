# Surfing: The New Board

So, I had been plateauing for a few months with my surfing progress. And I was
kind of torn between figuring which one is the problem, my lack of skills or the
board I had. It turned out, that in a way, it's both.

After a bit of consideration and talks to more grown up surfers, I've stepped
down from 6'8"x22"x2 3/4, to a shorter 6'1"x21"x2 7/8" fish. Meet the hatchet!

It's actually a really, really nice board. Made by a local, north shore shaper
for typical Sydney small waves. And it looks real pretty too!

At the beginning I was afraid that stepping down from 6'8" to 6'1" will be too
much of a drop for me. I had troubles pushing the old bigger one, and I was
expecting the new one will be way harder to deal with. Turned out I was actually
wrong.

The new board is definitely a challenge. It's shorter and narrower and has less
stability. But. At the same time it paddles really, really well. And what's more
important, it cooperates. The new board makes me work hard, but it also wants to
go places and take me with it.

See, turned out it's not a chicken and an egg problem. It's a co-dependency
problem. I couldn't build skills past a certain level, because I was fighting the
old board all the time. It just couldn't provide me with a space where I could
grow. Wicked, huh?

In just a few sessions with the new board, I'm actually making a good progress
with bottom turns. I'm nowhere near a cutback yet, but I definitely feel
where I need to go, and what I need to do now. I don't stumble in the darkness
anymore. I have a direction now.

Also, the story goes a bit further. A few days ago I went surfing with a friend
of mine, and I borrowed his proper narrow 6'1" shortboard. At the beginning I
thought there is no way I would be able to do just anything on it. But, turned
out, I actually can wield it!

I thought I don't have enough technique and fitness to push it. It's really
narrow, and feels almost like a rope after wide fishes I've been surfing so far.
And it was just 30 liters in volume. But, I actually could paddle it pretty well;
well, for a noob that is. And strangely enough, I managed to catch quite a few
waves with it as well. And actually do bottom turns. It was completely unexpected.
I thought I'm years away from that.

It's also interesting how differently it felt. Fishes are quite wide and have
lots of floatation. So, if it's also a quad like mine, it launches with a kick.
You feel like a wave punches you forward and you just jump on it and start
working. Turned out a small shortboard actually launches way slower. It kind of
submerges into the wave initially, which gives you an extra split second to
align yourself and get onto the right trajectory. Which helps a lot when it
comes to turning the thing later.

It was quite counter intuitive. I was expecting that a high performance board
will be all about speed and will be super hard to do anything on it for a noob.
But, now I see why people prefer them when they want to do more than just going
down the slope. They are maneuverable and very responsive and controllable. It
all makes way more sense to me now.

So, yeah. It's been pretty eventful and interesting couple of weeks in my surfing
life. I'm really glad I'm finally moving somewhere.

Also, a fun observation. When you have a proper board made by a local shaper, other
surfers look at you differently at the beach. I don't look like a kook anymore.
So, random people actually say "hi" and we chit-chat about boards now and then.
It makes me kind of happy. It makes me feel like I belong.
