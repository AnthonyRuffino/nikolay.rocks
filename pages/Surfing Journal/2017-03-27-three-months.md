# Surfing: Three Months

It appears to me that I fell off the radar with my surfing journal for three
entire months. This doesn't mean nothing happened. On the contrary, I've been
surfing 2-3-4 times a week through the entire summer. It's just I needed time
off.

End of the years are quite overwhelming on their own. And it was a very difficult
year. Like paddling into a strong current. And waves were slapping me in a face
one after another. I felt exhausted and empty on the inside by the end of it.

And then—as it usually is with paddling out—suddenly, I was through the impact
zone. I was on the other end. I'm just trying to catch some breath and look around
me. Because, now, after a long long time of waiting, I'm finally free to choose
my waves.

Surfing is a lot like life. After you stop freaking out at the sheer ambiguity of
it, you start seeing nuances. And then you start understanding how to work around
them.

At the beginning waves look like those things flipping over and crushing down.
Sheer wild energy. But, in a while, I realized that I was looking just at the
visible surface of it. The reality of it is way more complex.

A wave is a like a blob of energy. But, it is also kind of like an iceberg. The
bulk of the energy is under the water, and what you can see is just the tip of
it. The wave itself is a result of that under water energy blob hitting the
shore.

But, again, it is more complex than that. There is not just a difference between
how the energy hits the sand bank versus the same wave hitting a rocky point
break. There is also how it progresses after that. For example a wave can hit
a sand bank perfectly and create a great shape, but if after the sand bank
there is a dip in the bottom, then that wave will dissipate right under you.

And then there are also waves reflected from the rocky sides of the beach, and
from the beach itself. Those waves are almost invisible at the beginning, but
they travel in the opposite direction to the main waves, and when they hit
each other, you have nice rideable spikes.

This story helped me to realize that I'm afraid of complexity. Trying to understand
ins and outs of every complex system I run into, is my way to control it. It
made me a good knowledgeable engineer. But it also made me a miserable fuck,
because it is very hard to let go and just enjoy the moment.

If surfing taught me anything to this point, then it is that control is illusory
and basically a manifestation of fear. To get to the next level you need to let
go of it, lean in, and trust yourself that you will get through.
