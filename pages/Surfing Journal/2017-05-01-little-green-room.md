# The Little Green Room

Apparently this year was a bit of a rough season. Most of the February and March
were rather stormy. Lots of messy heavy chunks, lots of rain. Not exactly stellar
conditions for learning. I have had plenty of frustrating sessions. But, by the
end of April the shore lit up. Conditions are almost perfect. The water is ideal
temperature and the waves are nice hollow.

Last month I've been working on my paddling a lot. Actually. After a year of
trying hard and making a lot of mistakes, I have decided to look back at all the
training videos I used to watch when I was a beginner. And, interestingly enough,
a lot of ideas started to make way more sense.

When I was a beginner, the learning curve was rather steep. With such amount of
information flying by, it was hard to fully appreciate fine details that people
tried to explain. But, now I feel like there is some room in me for more wizdoms.

I've realized that my paddling wasn't super efficient. I've tried hard, even
exercised a lot outside of water time. But, turned out, I was spreading my arms
rather far to the sides. Apparently I was trying to balance this way on the board.
But, it made the whole paddling motion wobbly side to side, which created a lot
of drag. Also, i used to spread my legs sometimes. For the same reason, to balance
on the board. But, this again, this produced a lot drag. I'm still working on both,
but I can see a lot of improvement in speed and maintaining momentum.

Another thing I've realized is that I tend to stop paddling right when the wave
reaches me. Apparently, I was trying to get ready and align myself with the wave
for a take off. Unfortunately, that was a mistake. It made me loos momentum in
the critical moment and a lot of waves were passing me by because of that.
No wonder that when i became aware of the problem my wave count jumped.

Speaking of waves. I saw my first little green room today. Not particularly large,
barely head high, and it lasted no more than a second. But, it was perfect. The
morning sun was shining right through the lip and lighted up in all those
brilliant emerald and gold colors. Amazing!
