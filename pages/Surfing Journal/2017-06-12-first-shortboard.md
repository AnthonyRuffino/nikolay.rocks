# Surfing: The First Shortboard

It's been long coming, I suppose. But, after a year of paddling in, I got myself
the first proper shortboard thruster. And by proper, I mean it's an actual
shortboard, not a fish, not a hybrid, a shortboard. It also has the right volume
for me too. It's the DHD's epoxi-core Switchblade. Pretty fancy to be honest.

It's the fourth board that I ride, and, I suppose, I can compare now, and look
back at the whole journey.

Like most of the people who get into surfing, I started with a longboard. It
was great, but it was pretty hard to turn. Also, with a longboard, it was next to
impossible to paddle out into a bigger swell. Besides I wanted to be like the
cool kids.

Then I had a 6'8" (I think) hybrid fish-ish board. That thing could turn a bit,
but still was a lot of hustle to use in any larger swell.

Then I had a 6'1" fat fish. It's a fun little board in small waves. But, because
it has way too much volume for me (40 liters) it's not fun at all to paddle into
larger waves. Also, it's practically flat and has a super fast quad fin at the
back. As the result, catching anything taller than shoulder high was rather fiddly.

Now I stepped down to a 6'0" thruster with correct volume, and everything
fell into places. Although it's the smallest of them all, it paddles better than
everything I had before. Also it duck dives like it supposed to. And, being a
short thruster, it launches itself into head high waves controllably and predictably.

Here is the thing though. When I started, I've heard the same thing over and over
again: "start with a larger board and then progress down. you won't be able to
manage a shortboard straight away". I know that this was a good advise, I know
this is true. But, every next board I had felt quicker, more controllable and
easier to paddle.

Surfing is often counter intuitive like this. That's one of the reasons why I
love it so much. Yes, every next board feels like it's easier to deal with. But,
if you'd jump straight to the next thing you wouldn't be able to do anything
on it. You need the previous step experience to appreciate the next one.

Also, a lesson learned: don't buy your first boards yourself. Go into a store and
talk to an experienced seller. I know, this again sounds counter intuitive, asking
a sales person for an advise. But, trust me, they know what you need way better
than you do. Yes, it will cost you more money—especially if you don't know how to
negotiate—but you will save yourself months of frustration trying to tackle a
board that is not good for you. Besides, it is way easier to re-sell a good board
once you're done with it, than a shitty one.

I suppose that's all the wizdoms I have for you at the moment.
