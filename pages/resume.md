# Nikolay Nemshilov

Hi, I'm Nikolay, I'm what you might call a technical technical lead.
I help companies that are passionate about technology to build
outstanding products and stay nimble when it comes to shipping.

My primary strength is in a broad experience in web development related
areas. I built fully front-end projects, like the ChromeBooks ratail
app for Google for example. And then I built quite complicated government
documents processing server-side code for JobReady. And I also built
a massive JSON API based app for Ninefold that handles the server-side
infrastructure. Oh, and I have my very own iOS app on the
[app store](http://meowtvapp.com).

My passion for creating things doesn't leave me after work hours either.
I launched a number of open-source projects (see the list below); and I
constantly build fun projects and follow my passions.

And then the burning desire to share my knowledge and experiences
leads me to conferences, writing, and, sometimes, tops of the hacker news

## Technical Skills

I am lucky to be an early adopter of RubyOnRails and an early adopter
of NodeJS. This helped me to get involved professionally with almost
every major piece of technology that came out of those two great hubs
in the last 10 years.

Then, before getting my first MacBook, I lived 100% on Linux for a number
of years, which made me acquainted with Unix systems. I have designed
infrastructures for high-load web applications. And I helped hundreds
of rails projects to deploy on Ninefold.

And then, the mobile development wave swooped me as well, leading me
to build several large iOS projects and apps. Check out the
[under-os](http://under-os.com) project for example.


## Personal Background

It happened that I have a rather eclectic background. I was born in Siberia,
and I can tell you everything about fishing through a meter thick layer of ice.
I lived in Saint Petersburg for many years and I cant talk for hours about
post-impressionism art and my admiration for van Gogh paintings. I had
spent almost a year in South-East Asia, traveling from place to place
every few weeks. And I also had been to California and passionate about
the startup culture.
